       "      <td>Maxim is a monthly publication aimed at the younger male population, aged 16 to 30. This magazine offers a few amusing tidbits each month, like jokes and unusual ways to make things. There is an occasional fashion article, and some monthly articles on electronic gadgets and music. But the primary reason why people buy Maxim and the main reason it sells as well as it does is the women.\\nMaxim is not really an adult magazine, like Playboy or Penthouse. Its photographs do not expose so much that they should garner an X rating. But many of them come very close. From the picture on the cover (always a young woman, often with a seductive look in her eyes and much flesh exposed) to the photos in the middle, Maxim uses sex to sell. It isn't strictly a photo- op magazine for young women. There are interviews to accompany the visual effects. But the small talk is almost always geared toward sex- how to get it, how to keep getting it for a long time, how to improve your chances to get it, how to help friends get it, how to turn women on, etc.\\nThe photos in Maxim are enticing, and I don't think any red- blooded American male would deny this fact. But what hurts Maxim a little bit and what keeps it from gaining as much respect as it could have is the monthly dose of stupidity that comes with each issue. Much of what you find in the \"How to\" section, for example, is idiotic and I cannot imagine anyone taking it seriously. The \"Bar Exam\" feature is also bordering on stupidity, with a set of trivia questions each month about some type of useless information.\\nOverall, I think Maxim is at least an average magazine, in spite of its flaws. Yes, many of the articles are brainless and the humor is the type that would amuse a 12- year old. But the main reason people buy and read (or should I say look) at Maxim is the photographs of the women. With so much flesh exposed, without going to far, Maxim is a publication with a purely visual bend. You won't find much intelligence here, but you will find plenty of photos of scantily clad women, tempting your hormones with their youthful good looks and uninhibited personalities.</td>\n",

       "796   Maxim is a monthly publication aimed at the younger male population, aged 16 to 30. This magazine offers a few amusing tidbits each month, like jokes and unusual ways to make things. There is an occasional fashion article, and some monthly articles on electronic gadgets and music. But the primary reason why people buy Maxim and the main reason it sells as well as it does is the women.\\nMaxim is not really an adult magazine, like Playboy or Penthouse. Its photographs do not expose so much that they should garner an X rating. But many of them come very close. From the picture on the cover (always a young woman, often with a seductive look in her eyes and much flesh exposed) to the photos in the middle, Maxim uses sex to sell. It isn't strictly a photo- op magazine for young women. There are interviews to accompany the visual effects. But the small talk is almost always geared toward sex- how to get it, how to keep getting it for a long time, how to improve your chances to get it, how to help friends get it, how to turn women on, etc.\\nThe photos in Maxim are enticing, and I don't think any red- blooded American male would deny this fact. But what hurts Maxim a little bit and what keeps it from gaining as much respect as it could have is the monthly dose of stupidity that comes with each issue. Much of what you find in the \"How to\" section, for example, is idiotic and I cannot imagine anyone taking it seriously. The \"Bar Exam\" feature is also bordering on stupidity, with a set of trivia questions each month about some type of useless information.\\nOverall, I think Maxim is at least an average magazine, in spite of its flaws. Yes, many of the articles are brainless and the humor is the type that would amuse a 12- year old. But the main reason people buy and read (or should I say look) at Maxim is the photographs of the women. With so much flesh exposed, without going to far, Maxim is a publication with a purely visual bend. You won't find much intelligence here, but you will find plenty of photos of scantily clad women, tempting your hormones with their youthful good looks and uninhibited personalities.  \n",

Last month, I had the \"pleasure\" of reading a bombastic self-description of how a surgeon saved a patient's airway from his anesthesiologist. The article was so narcissistic and the story was so improbable for anybody who works in an operating room, that I'm 100% sure it was never fact-checked, not to speak about running it by an independent expert.\\n\\nSince then, I don't trust what I read there, and the magazine is too glossy for toilet paper, so I'll just cancel the subscription.   \n",

       "B00005NIPH  If you are making your living by writing you probably won't use this magazine as much as a hobbyist or a beginning writer.\\n\\nThis magazine makes a nice gift subscription for friends or family who enjoy writing for a hobby. Each issue comes with 3-4 large features or how-to articles. These articles focus on different aspects of the writing life, including development, marketing and interviews with published authors, agents and editors of publishing houses.\\n\\nAs other reviewers mentioned, most of the writing topics in this magazine and similar resources can be found online. That doesn't mean you should not buy a subscription as a gift.\\n\\nThe magazine is perfect for an older person who is not comfortable with computers or someone who doesn't have access to a high-speed Internet service. The monthly assortment of articles helps to encourage and stimulate a beginning writer. There are gems for everyone that can be found in a one-year subscription to Writer's Digest.   \n",

This is accomplished through the many instructional articles, how to guides, and question and answer sessions.\\n\\nWhen Maximum PC isn't offering words of wisdom on ways to improve your life with electronics, the magazine is usually offering reviews of new products. The reviews section is one of the largest parts of each issue and while it does a nice job bringing new products to the forefront, the reviews are often less than stellar. Rather than analyze a few products in- depth, Maximum PC instead prefers to offer shorter reviews of many products. This part of the magazine seems more concerned with quantity than quality, in contrast to most of the remainder of the magazine.\\n\\nOne thing about Maximum PC that isn't to my liking is the technical nature of many articles. Maximum PC likes to get to the root of things (literally), and it is common to find articles talking about circuits, memory, and other boring subjects. This is fine for those who take their technology to the extremes, but I have no interest in learning about the inter-workings of the wiring inside my personal computer or the electronic pulses that cause my printer to respond on queue. This is a little too much technology for me, but I know there are some readers who will relish the depths that Maximum PC goes to when it strips down electronic devices into their component parts.\\n\\nOverall, Maximum PC is a pretty good electronics magazine for young and middle- aged adults. It loses me from time to time when it gets overly technical, but it still ranks as a good magazine about electronics. The numerous question and answer sessions, the educational articles, and the product reviews make this a magazine worth reading.\",\n",

       "  'response': \"I think that in terms of overall content presented, 'Conde Nast Traveler' is the best travel magazine currently on the market. Some other reviewers have raised some valid points concerning article length, and bias toward upscale properties. I think that there are other magazines that might be more suitable for others, including 'Budget Travel' and 'National Geographic Traveler', both of which I also subscribe to and enjoy, though they both have their limitations and issues as well.\\nSo what sets 'Conde Nast' apart? I think it is the willingness to find new and exciting vacation destinations that are still reasonable enough to get to as to make them worthwhile to a large audience. Some of the more exotic magazines have great articles on hiking in Tibet and the like, but how many people are really able to do that (or can afford to do it?) My point is that although it is by no means perfect, I think the editors and writers do consciously strike a balance between the too mundane and too exotic (and expensive) and attempt to focus the majority of the magazine in that area.\\nThis is just too good of a magazine to pass up. The 'Deals of the Month' section alone justifies the price. Of all the travel magazines I read on a monthly basis (currently four) 'Conde Nast Traveler' is my favorite and I highly recommend it.\",\n",

       "  'response': \"It's important to understand that this magazine isn't about budget travel.  It's for people who travel for business, where a corporation is paying, and for those who can afford to travel luxuriously for pleasure, at least occasionally.  I love reading about exotic destinations, the top spas and bath experiences in the world, and amazing travel experiences.  It has gorgeous photography, interesting articles, and solid information.  Even if I can't afford to take trips like this every year, I still want to read about them.  If I'm going to take a once-in-a-lifetime trip I'll want to know just where to say and what to do.  When I went\\nto Florida I stayed in budget places except for the last night, when we went to the Hotel Fontainebleau on Miami Beach, which was wonderful.  It's important to know and decide when to save money and when it's worth it to splurge.\\n\\nI almost gave my subscription up because with physical disabilities it's unlikely I can do a lot of travel.  But I still want to dream about it.  I'd love a travel magazine that included information about vacation travel ideas for those of us who can't walk or stand for hours.  So many travel articles urge the traveler to get out and walk, but that isn't possible for all of us.  Conde Nast is a lot less likely to urge long impossible hikes on me than National Geographic Traveler.\",\n",

So my reluctance should not be construed as resentment.\\n\\nOK, enough of that. Given these caveats about high-end travel, Cond Nast can be a fascinating read. Some of it ('Escape from the Airport. Passenger power saves the day', Dec 2006) is valuable for air travelers on almost any budget.\\n\\nYet the *real* value of this magazine will be mined by those whose circumstances allow them to travel anywhere they want. For that kind of affluent tourist, Cond Nast can be a gold mine of opportunities that would otherwise be overlooked.\\n\\nIn my judgement, TRAVEL AND LEISURE beats CONDE NAST TRAVELER by a nose in this sector's competition, but either one will do you. If you had, say, five years of high-end travel in front of you, you'd do well to toss in some coins for subscriptions to both.\\n\\nFrequent travelers on a business or economy budget are likely to hold out for browsing in the dentist office waiting room or - as I do - snagging subscriptions to both via frequent flyer miles.\\n\\nBon voyage!\",\n",

We generally read it cover to cover.\\n\\nIt is truly what it claims to be- a magazine about family fun.\\n\\nThere is a section on rating or planning family vacations. We could do without this one section but even then it is well written and interesting.\\n\\nOther sections include family games, outdoor games, theme parties, crafts, and more. Kids cooking recipes, how other families solved problems, toy book and software reviews and even more. It is jam packed with fun things to do.\\n\\nMany of the kids things are directed towards children who are about 8. However, my children who are younger than 8 enjoy many of the things here and look forward to the magazine so they can find new things to try. My niece who is older than 8 still enjoys the activities in this magazine too.\\n\\nThis is a great gift for a teacher or a person who has children.',\n",

The past months articles on saving money were well thought out and were easy things to try.  The idea of putting a filled bottle water in the back of your toilet to decrease how much water needed per flush was a great idea!  The one reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because of the constant need to have celebrities on the front cover while the articles about them aren't direct interviews - just some statements made to other people here and there.

Good Housekeeping has existed for many years and is ranked 5th in the USA for sales! It has a circulation of over 4,000,000. It covers an array of topics including: food, fitness, beauty, child care, money management, health news, travel, and human interest stories. This is a magazine that would be great for any homemaker (is that one word or two?) If you are a parent or someone who has their own place, this magazine could be a big benefit to you.

Fashion and beauty gives ideas on the latest nail color or makeup tips. The articles on relationships are interesting.\\n\\nThis magazine also has sections for: Health & Well Being, Consumer Sense, The Better Way, Food & Home, Fiction, Departments and Columns. The TECH section is always of interest. There is a definite focus on women, as in: \"The Best Cell Phones for Women.\" Plus, this is where you can find Heloise giving out the newest Household Tips.\\n\\nMy favorite page is the looks, trends, and news page where they always give you ideas for holidays or feature beauty products like Pumpkin Pie body wash in November. The recipes are often multicultural and you can find anything from Lebkuchen to Pavlova with Passion Fruit Sorbet.\\n\\nIn my top 10 of favorite magazines!\\n\\n~The Rebecca Review',\n",

But the ads are helpful to the reader because they often include bargain prices. There are also classified ads from other readers who have island vacation property to rent.\\nIf you like to travel and you love water, then Islands magazine is a great publication to read.

However, I admit that I spotted this November 2014 magazine issue of Outside at my job and obviously decided to take a chance on it.  There are interesting articles in this issue such as: page sixty to seventy one titled under Work< Play, Live: This Way Forward An Eight Step Plan For Rebooting Your Career and Finding A Job You Love by Abe Streep. Illustrations are by Peter Arkle and the following are some of the men and women featured: Adam Fetcher 37, Director of Global PR And Communications Patagonia. Fetcher worked on multiple press jobs  in the Department of Homeland Security, he then worked on President Obamas re-election campaign in 2012, and launched a communications firm in Minnesota before being contacted by Patagonia in 2013. Tom Stewart, Michael Charley, and Megan Miller are some of the multiple people featured within the inspirational article. What I enjoyed the most about the story being written is that some of the men and women featured are in their late 30s/early 40s which sends a positive message that a person can experience a career breakthrough later in life regardless of their professional aims and/or what their skeptics think.',\n",

       "  'response': \"Popular Mechanics is a magazine dedicated to mechanics, repair, industry, and technology. This magazine offers timely articles that are often intelligent, thought- provoking, and often fascinating and/or awe- inspiring. They often talk about mechanical achievements, impressive technology, record- setting feats, etc. These articles show what humans are capable of doing and they remain in your memory for some time.\\n\\nThese achievement- type articles are often the best in each issue, however, Popular Mechanics is more than just a magazine about incredible achievements. With Popular Mechanics, you get articles about cars, home improvement, repair, etc., which are more practical than anything. Car enthusiasts often enjoy Popular Mechanics more than anyone, due to the magazine's consistent articles on automobiles and reviews of automobiles. There are, in fact, multiple articles on automobiles and/or automotive technology in each issue and they are often among the lengthiest in the magazine.\\n\\nBesides cars, Popular Mechanics likes to devote space to the subject of home repair and improvement. These articles are nice because they offer practical advice that can help do- it- yourself readers save a good deal of cash. They are often educational in nature, too. How Your House Works, for example, is a subsection of the Home department and it describes in detail how a certain part of your home functions. It might sound boring at first, but it is often fascinating to learn what goes on behind the walls, under the foundation, inside the appliances, etc. Sometimes, the educational lesson is obvious but other times, the lessons learned are eye- opening and will expose homeowners to things about their home they never knew existed.\\n\\nPopular Mechanics is, overall, a very nice publication that I will continue to read. I like the articles that emphasize fascinating innovation and achievement best, but I can also agree that the home and automotive articles are very practical and useful. The over- emphasis on automobiles is a small complaint about Popular Mechanics, but the magazine as a whole is very good and very readable.\",\n",

       "  'response': \"Bottom-line: Popular Science is my new personal science and technology advisor designed to enrich my knowledge of science and technology spanning the globe.\\n\\nI have always delved into the minutia of how things work.  This natural curiosity grew from, where I don't know where it comes from exactly.  Perhaps it part of the male brain, or perhaps just part of mine; I like to take things apart and see how they work.  It's not enough to know that if I pay my electric bill on time, when I flick on a light switch I will have light; I want to know how the electricity is generated and how it got to the switch.  That same curiosity led me to my current profession as an Information Technology professional.  What started out as a hobby, a need to know how computers worked, has turned into a second career for me.\\n\\nAll of this explains why I subscribe to and read Popular Science Magazine [...], whose slogan is The Future Is Now.  As magazines go, Popular Science is a pretty thin rag, but that does not mean the monthly is not packed with all manner of useful and informative information.  it does mean that the magazine is not (over) burdened with page after page of annoying advertising.  There is of course advertising, a magazine could not survive without it, but is it not overly intrusive and overbearing.\\n\\nRegular sections in the magazine include:\\n\\no Features: feature length articles;\\no Megapixels\\no What's New\\no Headlines\\no How 2.0\\no FYI\\no Other Stuff: includes Letters, and editor's note.\\n\\nMy favorite section is What's New; I tend to read it first every month.  Each section is filled with six or seven pages of text and illustrations one the latest and greatest new products and prototypes from across the world in the science, general technology and astronomy fields. The latest issue featured a big bold article on the future of police equipment, called Cop Tech; Inside The Police R&R Lab. A flashy title to be sure, but is backed up with quality writing as well as pictures and or images of the equipment and gadgets discussed in the article.\\n\\nOther articles in this month's (February 2007) magazine include:\\n\\no Protect Everything; the future of personal security.\\no Journey From The Center of The Earth; Popsci Innovator\\no It Came From The Lab; Uncommon Knowledge\\no Fly The Friendly Seas; Concepts & Prototypes\\n\\nThe articles for the most part are well written, concise, and comprehensive.  Aside from the feature articles, the most informative portion of the magazine are the one or two page explanation features wherein some present or future gadget is explained, usually accompanied by an illustration.  For example on page 27 of this month's issue under the Headlines section the magazine explains in great detail--complete with illustration--how the Department of Energy is building a greener coal plant, that will extract Hydrogen--called Syngas--from water and use it to produce electricity.

       "  'response': \"Bottom-line: Popular Science is my new personal science and technology advisor designed to enrich my knowledge of science and technology spanning the globe.\\n\\nI have always delved into the minutia of how things work.  This natural curiosity grew from, where I don't know where it comes from exactly.  Perhaps it part of the male brain, or perhaps just part of mine; I like to take things apart and see how they work.  It's not enough to know that if I pay my electric bill on time, when I flick on a light switch I will have light; I want to know how the electricity is generated and how it got to the switch.  That same curiosity led me to my current profession as an Information Technology professional.  What started out as a hobby, a need to know how computers worked, has turned into a second career for me.\\n\\nAll of this explains why I subscribe to and read Popular Science Magazine [...], whose slogan is The Future Is Now.  As magazines go, Popular Science is a pretty thin rag, but that does not mean the monthly is not packed with all manner of useful and informative information.  it does mean that the magazine is not (over) burdened with page after page of annoying advertising.  There is of course advertising, a magazine could not survive without it, but is it not overly intrusive and overbearing.\\n\\nRegular sections in the magazine include:\\n\\no Features: feature length articles;\\no Megapixels\\no What's New\\no Headlines\\no How 2.0\\no FYI\\no Other Stuff: includes Letters, and editor's note.\\n\\nMy favorite section is What's New; I tend to read it first every month.  Each section is filled with six or seven pages of text and illustrations one the latest and greatest new products and prototypes from across the world in the science, general technology and astronomy fields. The latest issue featured a big bold article on the future of police equipment, called Cop Tech; Inside The Police R&R Lab. A flashy title to be sure, but is backed up with quality writing as well as pictures and or images of the equipment and gadgets discussed in the article.\\n\\nOther articles in this month's (February 2007) magazine include:\\n\\no Protect Everything; the future of personal security.\\no Journey From The Center of The Earth; Popsci Innovator\\no It Came From The Lab; Uncommon Knowledge\\no Fly The Friendly Seas; Concepts & Prototypes\\n\\nThe articles for the most part are well written, concise, and comprehensive.  Aside from the feature articles, the most informative portion of the magazine are the one or two page explanation features wherein some present or future gadget is explained, usually accompanied by an illustration.  For example on page 27 of this month's issue under the Headlines section the magazine explains in great detail--complete with illustration--how the Department of Energy is building a greener coal plant, that will extract Hydrogen--called Syngas--from water and use it to produce electricity.

       "  'response': \"Popular Science is a magazine I have been reading on and off for more than twenty years and it ranks as a science magazine for the masses. As most readers will tell you, Popular Science is a beginner's science publication and is generally intended for those who are curious about science and want to gain a better understanding of science and technology.\\n\\nPopular Science is more about technology than science and this is evident from the departments and most of the featured articles. Yes, Popular Science does include articles about atoms, chemicals, outer space, physics, etc., but the majority of the articles are about modern technology and its uses and applications. The technology articles are dedicated to subjects such as new vehicles, environmental trends, electronic devices, and more. Articles like these might seem a little out of scope, but one has to remember that the first word in the title of the magazine is Popular. Technology is huge, so it makes sense that the magazine would dedicate such a large percentage of its articles to high tech.\\n\\nThe writing in Popular Science is very good, but as I said before, this magazine is intended more as a beginner's guide to science and technology. This means the articles will be perfectly fine for those with limited science and technology knowledge.  For those with a more advanced scientific mind, some of the articles may be too elementary. However, every issue can be counted on for at least a couple of in-depth, intellectual articles. Also, one needs to keep in mind that the articles are generally short and cover only a page or two. This is nice for those with shorter attention spans and for those who want to soak up as many facts about as many different things as possible.\\n\\nLearning more about science and technology is certainly a good idea and Popular Science is a good choice of reading material for those who are scientifically curious, want to improve their science knowledge level, and want to learn about the latest technology. The magazine could prove to be a little too simplistic for those with a working or educational background in science, but for everyone else, Popular Science presents a good means to keep up with the latest in science and high tech with writing that is clear and intelligent without going over the top.\",\n",

Recently, Seventeen got a new look and feel, with more mature articles and interesting features for older teeens. Seventeen is good for those teens who feel like they've outgrown other teen magazines but want one that will guide them through college and beyond.\\nSeventeen features many stuff that teens like to read about- the latest celebrity news, CD and movie release dates, fashion and beauty tips, love and romance, real-life stories, fun stuff to do, and more. As an added bonus, Seventeen covers more worldwide issues then other teen magazines and gives them to you from a teen's point of view. Seventeen also gives you plenty of college and sex advice, which older readers will connect with.\\nWhat I love about Seventeen is not only the plentiful amounts of news and real-life stories, but also that it features many bargain items in the Fashion section that are awesome and affordable. Seventeen is a wonderful magazine for bargain shopppers- it features plenty of clothes, make-up, hair products, and jewelry for those with smaller budgets. Additionally, the health and fitness pull outs in each issue are wonderful! Seventeen has plenty of nutrition tips and simple workouts that'll have you seeing lots of results fast.\\nSeventeen is a wonderful magazine overall- highly recommended.\",\n",

Are you a person who loves to read about celebrities as well as the latest in music, movies, and TV? Then Seventeen is for YOU!!! In fact, Seventeen has all of these and much more! From recipes to inspiring life stories, from sex to cool celebrity photos, Seventeen is packed with informative and entertaining articles, plus, lots of cool colorful photographs.\\nAccording to the Audit Bureau of Circulations list of the 100 best selling magazines in the United States, Seventeen is ranked 25th, but none of the ones above Seventeen on the list are directed at teens and young women, thus, making Seventeen the best selling magazine for young readers. It has over 2,000,000 readers to date, and that number is growing. But, not only is Seventeen a best seller, it's also one of the most sought after collectibles in the world! At auctions, I've seen editions from the 70's and 80's sell for as much as [money]each, depending on things such as condition, who was on the cover, etc. And I've noticed that editions of Seventeen do not have to be very old to bring a good price. I've seen editions as little as 2 years old sell for upwards of [money] each. I fell in love with the magazine when I was 17. I was in class when I noticed one of my classmates reading a copy. As I peered over her shoulder, I seen in the magazine one of the most beautiful girls in the world. Turned out, the model would later turn into one of the hottest actresses in film----Phoebe Cates. So I asked my classmate where I could get a copy and she told me I could find them in most any store or get them by subscription. So because of Phoebe Cates, I started collecting the magazine just for her lovely pics. Later, stars such as Brooke Shields,and Jennifer Connelly kept me buying the magazine. Then I began to read the articles and found them both interesting and informative. I can say with assurance that some of the articles in Seventeen have helped keep me looking younger and healthier. So while Seveteen is directed mainly at young women between the ages of 12 and 20, guys can also benefit from some of its contents. It's a magazine that has existed since 1944, and is a favorite among every class of people. If you would like a magazine that is great to read and can be worth something as a collectible in the future, you cannot beat SEVENTEEN!!!\",\n",

       "  'response': \"If it is in Vogue, it IS in fashion! This magazine, which has existed since 1892, is one of the premier magazines for women. It is an American magazine, but also has Australian, Brazilian, British, French, German, Italian, and Spanish Editions. It covers fashion, beauty, health, fitness, celebrities, movies, art, and other topics of interest to women. Vogue is mainly directed at the Jet-Set, but anyone will find its pages both entertaining, and informative. I have a subscription to it, and I collect it on the basis of its collectibility. Mine arrive in clear plastic bags, which are never opened (unless of course one of my favorite celebritie's is on the cover). I wish all magazine publishers used the clear bag method of shipping, because an subscription label directly on the cover of a magazine is frowned upon by most collectors. So unless you buy it right off the shelf, or it is bagged, most collectors will not be interested in it. Getting back to Vogue, if you want to keep up with what is IN in fashion, this is the magazine to have. You know those $1,000 dresses you've heard about? You'll find many of them modeled in here! Fashions photographed by some of the world's most renowned photographers, are featured in the magazine. If you're someone who enjoys reading about the Elite in women's topics, you'll want to subscribe to VOGUE.\",\n",

There are always great articles about what is new and upcoming in techonology, new trends on the Internet.  Some magazines have a lot of filler and tend to be a vehicle for selling advertisements.\\n\\nWhat makes Wired extra special is that they don't pander to products that they do advertising for.

They often feature articles written by famous people in techonology.\\n\\nI have operated a cooking website since 1995, so I am familar with the Internet, and how it works.

Wired magazine is fresh, and is free of pandering to the products they help advertise.  I like that this magazine is high on content and low in advertisements.  Always fresh content about new products in techonology, trends in the high tech world, and a good insight on the Internet make this magazine an excellent choice.\",\n",

       "  'response': \"Wired is a semi- interesting magazine that blends together articles about technology with those on politics, culture, and more. This magazine is aimed at a diverse audience but it generally caters to those who are technology savvy and like to keep up with the latest world events.\\n\\nWired dedicates most of its pages to the discussion of electronics and other technology and computer nerds form a large percentage of the magazine's core subscribers. Articles about digital cameras, high definition televisions, internet marketing, and other like topics can be found in every issue. These articles often present unique angles on common problems and concerns in the world of high tech.\\n\\nWhat makes Wired interesting is the fact that it includes other articles on other subjects- topics that one normally would not associate with a technology magazine. It is common to find articles about popular culture, politics, and other topics and they sometimes seem out of place. One minute you're reading an article about PDA's and the next minute you're reading an article about the war against Iraq. It's a little weird but it also makes for a nice change of pace as you read.\\n\\nAnother interesting fact with Wired is that it changes its authors more frequently than other magazines. The magazine has a few regulars but it likes to shuffle the writers around each month. This can be good and it can result in articles that present new and different perspectives each month. But it also means that the magazine is a little uneven and can sometimes include articles that do not communicate the way they should. I can recall reading several articles that left me scratching my head, wondering why the editor didn't make additional changes so that the articles were clearer.\\n\\nThe departments in Wired cover a large percentage of the space in every issue and they exceed the total length of many other magazines' department sections. The departments (with the exception of one) occupy the first two- thirds of each issue. The monthly featured articles are found near the end of each issue. This layout is different from other magazines that mix the departments and monthly features together. With Wired, the departments and featured articles are kept separate.\\n\\nOverall, I like Wired as a whole and the political articles rank as my favorite part of each issue. The magazine jumps around from topic to topic and the authors change more frequently than other magazines; two facts that could make Wired a little too scattered for certain readers. Some of the articles are not the best written I have ever seen but Wired is still a good enough magazine to recommend. It keeps readers current on technology, politics, business, and entertainment with a reputation for being modern and hip.\",\n",

       "  'response': \"Health Magazine is a publication that gears its articles toward a wide array of health- related issues and concerns. When I came across a copy for the first time, I picked it up to read with a degree of skepticism. I thought it would be a magazine exclusively about nutrition, but that turned out not to be the case. This magazine does spend some time talking about healthy eating habits, but this is only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to this magazine. The editors of this publication talk about all sorts of health topics, like mental health, relationships, parenting, physical fitness, etc. Because of this, Health has something that will appeal to almost anyone who reads it.\\n\\nThis magazine is divided into five main areas: Beauty, Body, Fitness, Mind, and Food. My personal favorites are the Mind and Food sections. I like the Mind area the best because it's the one where I usually find articles that are most relevant to my own health concerns. Here, you can learn about useful things like how to reduce stress in your work and in life, how to deal with problem children, and other informative topics. To a lesser extent, I also like the Food section because it includes some very interesting recipes that show how you can spice up ordinary, routine meals for little cost and minimal effort.\\n\\nIf there is one thing to criticize about this publication, it would have to be the fact that it is primarily geared toward women. The Beauty section, for example, is focused almost entirely on feminine concerns, with advice on makeup, eliminating wrinkles, etc. Some of these articles could, of course, be applied toward men but they are mostly centered on woman and the models used in the photos throughout most of the sections of the magazine are female. On the flip side, however, my criticism will prove to be an asset for women, many of whom will find this magazine very useful.\\n\\nStill, in spite of this small criticism, Health is still a very good magazine for all to read. Remember- this is not just a nutrition magazine. The importance of vitamins, minerals, fats, proteins, and carbs comprises only a small part of the publication. The remaining sections of the magazine feature some very useful articles on mental health, relationships, disease control and prevention, healthy cooking, etc., making Health a good publication with articles and columns that anyone can relate to.\",\n",

       "  'response': 'Bottom-Line: A glossy well put together magazine \"Bon Appetit Magazine\" is well worth the subscription that is if you are a serious cook.  And even a not so serious one.\\n\\nThe world of cooking, gourmet and otherwise magazines is festooned with glossy covers adorned with tempting dishes of un-nameable foods we are supposed to enjoy preparing. But \"Bon Appetit Magazine\" has them all whipped with its life-sized scrumptious looking delicacies begging to be devoured.  For instance the June 2008 issue has a picture of a Cheddar Burger with Chipotle Ketchup; the life-sized burger looks absolutely delectable.\\n\\n\"Bon Appetit Magazine\", which bills itself as a food and entertaining magazine, is published monthly by Conde Nast Publications Inc. and is aimed at serious-minded cooks who passionate about the dishes they prepare.  They, like me are interested in what new in the world of cooking; not only that but they, like me have a keen interest in straying from the norm in the dishes they cook.\\n\\nUnfortunately like most magazines in America, \"Bon Appetit Magazine\" depends heavily on advertising to generate revenue, dedicates every other page to colorful spreads bent on selling us stuff we don\\'t really need, or in some cases don\\'t need but really, really want, but can\\'t afford.  To its credit, most of the advertising is dedicated to cooking and the stuff of cooks.\\n\\nBon Appetit Magazine Contents\\n\\n\"Bon Appetit Magazine\" --a monthly publication--is a striking combination of the trivial and useful information and divided up in the following sections:\\n\\no Fast, Easy, Fresh\\no Family Style:\\no At the Market\\no Cooking Life\\no Health Wise\\no Wine & Spirits\\no Prep School\\no Features\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nA glossy well put together magazine \"Bon Appetit Magazine\" is well worth the subscription that is if you are a serious cook.  However, even the not-so-serious cook will find something within the folds of the gorgeous magazine.  When all is said and done I enjoy reading \"Bon Appetit Magazine\" not only because of the well put together articles and outstanding recipes, but also because the food look so darned inviting!  How come my dishes never turn out looking like the cover of a magazine?\\n\\nWhile I have to admit that some of the recipes are a little out there, the ones I have prepared have turned out well enough.  Be prepared you will have to shop for these ingredients; the average \"Bon Appetit\" recipe does not use your usual American kitchen staples.\\n\\nFor instance in the June 2008 issue a recipe for Hazelnut-crusted chicken with raspberry sauce calls for lightly packed fresh raspberries, safflower oil, chopped hazelnuts, panko (Japanese breadcrumbs), and finely chopped mint leaves; not exactly stuff one might find at the local Jewel.\\n\\nDid I mention that the photography in \"Bon Appetit Magazine\" is a feast in-and-of-itself?  No doubt there is a healthy dose of staging and a whole lot of Photoshop behind the gloss, but the effect is real enough.  Ready to pick one up yet?',\n",

Some of my favorite issues includes the topics of barbecue (I love some of the ribs recipes they have printed over the years) and Thanksgiving. What I am not so wild about is that a lot of the recipes over the years have become so high end. From my point of view, a lot of these meals are not every day meals you would make. I am blessed to live in a big city where I can find most of the ingredients but if I lived in a smaller city or town, it probably would be difficult to find.

A monthly publication, this magazine is designed to appeal to those who are presently owners of a small enterprise or who aspire to open their own business in the near future.\\n\\nWhat I enjoy most about this magazine are its personal articles- stories about ordinary people like you and me who have successfully started a new business venture. These people share their success stories with the reader, offering insight on what strategies helped them reach their present level of success and what challenges they still face. The people featured in the articles are more down to earth types who own smaller companies, making the magazine more realistic and something I and others can better relate to. Many other business magazines spend too much time interviewing billionaire CEO\\'s and others who, while they may have some interesting stories to share, live lifestyles and have problems that only someone of their stature can relate.\\n\\nOn the practical side, Entrepreneur contains many timely articles about common issues/problems/challenges that arise when you own your own company. Money, marketing, management, and other key topics are covered in each issue, with a regular department for these critical aspects of business ownership. In these sections, you can learn about tax law changes, legal issues with benefits, and other related topics.\\n\\nEntrepreneur organizes each issue quite nicely, with colored tabs on the pages that indicate which section (money, technology, marketing, etc.) they pertain to. This makes it that much easier to sift through, to find the information you need. And there is a section titled \"Sources\" that helps to index the different services and companies mentioned in each issue.\\n\\nOverall, this is a useful, practical magazine that can come in very handy for present business owners and for those who have an interest in proprietorship. It keeps business owners up to date with the latest changes in laws and it offers some creative solutions to the everyday problems that small businesses encounter each day.',\n",

       "  'response': 'I ordered this magazine (Mens Journal) through Amazon June 19th, 2015 for a bargain price. I just received my first (September-2015) issue (August 7, 2015) which took a month and a half.  I found the magazine to have many interesting articles and departments.  I especially enjoyed reading Style & Design 2015, Secrets of a secret agent by Josh Eells and The lethal thrills of BASE jumping by Phil Klay.\\n\\nOther departments include: Record book, four-day week-end, adventure, travel, dispatch, food, spirits, fashion and essay.  I also enjoyed the health & fitness section explaining the facts about eating red meat. The last word column was also interesting with an interview with Merle Haggard. This magazine is aimed obviously at the young professional man who likes cars, tech tools and adventure hobbies.\\n\\nIf you are into fashion, cars, high tech tools and adventure you should check out this mens magazine.\\nRating: 4 Stars.

       "  'response': 'Pretty good magazine.  5 stars because it is a mens magazine that does not exploit women every month.  Now and then there is a pretty lady on the front or inside, moderation is good.  Again also just happy because there are so few (guy) and (actual print) magazines out there.  Magazines and newspapers are meant to be read in the physical form.  Complaint- the advertisemnts are for some extremely expensive products, that most americans cannot or will not buy.  Also when the magazine does some review the products most of the time the products are way to expensive for most middle class to poor americans.',\n",

       "  'response': 'Bottom-Line: If you are looking for a magazine written for the not-so-average Joe, \"Men\\'s Journal Magazine\" might be for you.\\n\\nThe world of Men\\'s magazines, or magazines that are marketed towards a certain portion of the male reading populace, is littered with twaddle that only seems to appeal to the baser instincts of the male gender.  You know the magazines; they need not be mentioned here.  Some are happily folding tent never to heard from again.  Truth be told there are very few magazines that appeal to the more intellectual side of a man (yes ladies we do have such a side).\\n\\nBut recently as \"special gift\" for renewing my Bally\\'s Total Fitness membership I received a 1 year subscription to \"Men\\'s Journal Magazine\", \"a general interest, active lifestyle magazine with a focus on adventure, travel, equipment, sports, fitness, health, and style.\"\\n\\n\"Men\\'s Journal Magazine\", is published monthly by Wenner Media, the same publishing house that brings us such notable sidewalk fare as Us Weekly and Rolling Stone.  The magazine will set you back $3.95 an issue at the local newsstand, but 1 year subscriptions can be had for $9.95.  Inside each approximately 120-page magazine you will not find half clothed women dripping with sexy come hither stares.  Nor will you find the next Hollywood \"it\" girl, or wannabe skinny model with a fake tan gracing the pages of this Men\\'s magazine.  No, \"Men\\'s Journal\" is serious business folks; vapid men with one track minds and adolescent libido\\'s need not apply!\\n\\n\"Men\\'s Journal\" is a smartly written, thoughtfully designed magazine for the active intellectual male.  The magazine offer feature-length articles on a wide range of subjects based on the magazine\\'s central theme: adventure, travel, equipment, sports, fitness, health, and style.\\n\\nHowever, like most magazines in America, \"Men\\'s Journal\" depends heavily on advertising to generate revenue, but unlike fashion magazines that seem to be 90% advertising and 10% substance, \"Men\\'s Journal\" only dedicates every other page to colorful spreads bent on selling us stuff we don\\'t really need, or in some cases don\\'t need but really, really want, but can\\'t afford.  To its credit, most of the advertising is not dedicated to men\\'s fashions, wore by young impeccably sculpted and groomed men, or automobiles that are impossibly expensive, but instead to the business of adventure and sports.\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nWhen all is said and done I enjoy reading \"Men\\'s Journal Magazine.\"  Granted, given my current lifestyle (my days of adventures have been traded in for the American Dream and all that entails for now), the information the magazine imparts is only marginally useful to me.  The fitness articles are rater short and are mostly how-to\\'s that while useful are just barely so.  Most of the equipment discussed in Men\\'s Journal is for the magazines target audience with the appropriate disposable income; that\\'s not me.\\n\\nNonetheless, when my subscription runs out in another ten months I will probably renew.  Why?  Because \"Men\\'s Journal\" represents my kind of man: thoughtful, intelligent, adventurous (hey, I used to ride submarines, hike mountains and scuba dive and I still want to go sky-diving), man who actually appreciates full-length feature articles or two written by grown-ups for grown-ups.\\n\\nIf you are looking for a magazine written for the not-so-average Joe, filled with those little tidbits in life only men can appreciate, but also brings a healthy infusion of intelligent to its well written and information pages, \"Men\\'s Journal Magazine\" might be for you.',\n",

That's a pretty good shot at the content, since it takes your average young rich guy's (or no-longer-young-in-the-mirror rich guy's) desires to live a little on the wild side and decks them out in luxury opportunities to do just that.\\n\\nThe writing is surprisingly good. We're not talking the Atlantic Monthly here, but recent issues have easy-on-the-eyes features on the crisis in Darfur, the late Aussie croc-wrestler Steve Irwin, and the down-in-the-mouth financial situation of our National Parks system.\\n\\nLike most magazines of the genre, the gloss, paper quality, and color make this an easy read in an airplane seat or an easy chair: Men's Journal is pleasant to the touch, good for some mild distraction, and leaves no bitter aftertaste.\",\n",

       "  'response': \"Men's Journal is a decent magazine full of varied topics of interest to men. This magazine covers areas like sports, adventure travel, fashion and style, cars and trucks, career issues, etc. This publication directs all of its articles toward men, with an emphasis on what is most appealing to males throughout a typical week in their lives.\\n\\nOne thing about Men's Journal that is a little different from other men's magazines is that it doesn't flaunt women to sell its issues. In fact, there are practically no pictures of women at all in this publication- something that will be considered an asset to some, and a liability to others. This magazine refuses to play the female card and instead focuses its articles on topics that men like to read about.\\n\\nMen's Journal is often obsessed with lists, and I think this is especially true in the last few years. Take a look at the cover of most issues and you will see a large, boldface advertisement for some sort of list. In one issue, it might be a ranking of the best cities for entry level jobs. In another issue, it might be a listing of the best places for young entrepreneurs. Whatever it might be, Men's Journal seems to have an infatuation with lists, probably because men like lists and it helps increase sales.\\n\\nThis magazine can be counted on to produce some fairly good reading, but I must warn that many of the articles are a little too simplistic, with little emphasis on intellectualism. Even the articles about politics and business are often riddled with obvious statements that most anyone would know. But overall, I still think Men's Journal is a good magazine. It is varied enough that most anyone will find something interesting to read and the price is very low.\",\n",

       "  'response': \"Parents magazine is a very good publication about raising kids to be happy, healthy adults. It offers some good advice about the task of parenthood, illustrating the hard work and rewards that go hand in hand if parents perform their role in the best possible manner.\\n\\nI like this magazine as a whole, but there are a few things that potential readers need to know about before they pick up a copy to read. First of all, the articles in Parents magazine deal mostly with younger children, below twelve years of age. You won't find much of value in this magazine if you have teenagers. It is intended more for families with youngsters.\\n\\nAnother thing about this magazine that makes it less practical than it otherwise would be is the suggestions for family activities. The ideas presented here are all pretty good, but the problem is that the majority of them involve outlays of cash and/or time that are unrealistic for most families. I can agree, for example, that adding a game room would make a nice addition to one's house and would add tremendously to a family's time spent together. But how many among us can afford a home addition? Parents magazine talks about activities and enhancements like this in an unrealistic way, making them seem much simpler and easier to implement than they really are.\\n\\nAside from distractions like that, however, Parents is a very good magazine to read. It's one of the longest magazines you can buy, with 200 to 300 pages per issue. Add to that the low subscription price, a few pages of coupons, and the generally sound parental advice and you have all the makings of a good magazine for young families.\",\n",

There are so many things she finds useful about the magazine - I can tell you she spends several hours reading each issue and regularly cuts out articles to save in our \"parenting\" file or to put on the fridge.  Here are just a few of the great regular features of each monthly issue:\\n- \"As They Grow\", pointers and insights related to a particular subject, one each for eight different age groups (from pregnancy to pre-teen years)\\n- \"can you help?\", suggestions from readers about how to handle a common problem, such as the dentist or cutting your child\\'s nails\\n- Suggestions to keep your child busy in the house\\n- An Emergency Guide pull-out for dealing with various situations like electrical shock, bee stings, etc.\\n- Product recalls, usually with pictures\\n- Product testing and reviews (similar to Consumer Reports)\\nWhy not 5 stars?  There are a couple annoying features in the magazine, such as \"out of the mouths of babes\" and some of the suggestions for children\\'s activities around the house sound easier to do than they really are (sort of like what people say about Martha Stewart).  It can also be a bit of a downer to read the stories about serious illnesses some children have had and how their families cope - not always what you\\'re in the mood for when you\\'re thinking about your own healthy child.  But overall, this magazine is the best one out there for parents AND they are branching out - we recently started receiving Baby Parents.  It\\'s tough to know everything about raising your child so outside sources of information are key.  Parents magazine is a great resource that has been well worth the small subscription price.',\n",

The authors manage to give the same advice every month and make it sound different.  That may be one of the things that makes this magazine so motivational.  I keep reading about people who have run every day for the last fifty years or who run in 30 below weather, and I wonder what's keeping me off the roads.\\nThe Rave Run two page spread photographs are lovely.  They each show a runner in a really cool environment with a quote.  I have some of them hanging on my wall.  I get especially motivated by the one of a man running through the woods when the trees are coated with ice and the ground blanketed with snow.  It looks so beautiful, who wouldn't want to go out and run.  The ask the expert or Q&A section has the most diverse and informative information from month to month mostly because the questions come from readers and the answers come for a variety of experts.  The nutrition section isn't particularly useful.  The science seems simplified to the point that it isn't exactly true, and the suggested menu for one of the carbohydrate dinners starts out with 1 cup broiled swordfish along with five or six other things; not really practical in my opinion.\\nRunner's World has a nice coverage of racing events past (results) and future (racing calendars), and my hometown of Boulder, CO is mentioned somewhere at least once per issue :).  Runner's World encourages everyone to be a winner even if he or she doesn't finish first.  It is full of tips for beginners just staring to run and more advance information about training for seasoned amateurs.

The kind of magazine with flashy pictures, expensive wines and places you can never afford to go to. This is a good magazine, but I find level of advertising annoying. Also, the reviews of hotels don't strike me as that reliable. Last month, based on a review in this magazine about an inn, we stayed the night at this location and found the service was awful, the 'rooms with fireplaces' not functional and the room smelled bad. These facts were conveniently left out of the review which touted the friendly staff and the great rooms. So I guess, ultimately, I'd take reviews and articles in the magazine with a grain of salt.\\n\\nI DO however like the recipes, particularly the ones which come out around harvest/Thanksgiving time.\\n\\n4 stars\",\n",

       "  'response': 'Sunset is a magazine dedicated to the people, culture, and lifestyle of the American west. This magazine divides its space among many different topics, such as food and entertainment, travel, recreation, gardening and more.\\n\\nI have been reading this magazine for about six months now and there are several things about it that make it worthwhile. The thing that stands out the most are the photographs, and I\\'m not talking about just the stunning scenery one normally associates with the West (like the National Parks or the coastline). Even the ordinary pictures are striking. In the Gardening section, for example, it is common to find pictures of family homes that have beautifully landscaped yards full of blossoming flowers and colorful plants. In the Home & Design section, one can find nice photographs of home interiors, showing different designs and furniture.\\n\\nOne of the most unique qualities of Sunset is the fact that it is published in five different editions. There is a specially designed issue for the Northwest (Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Alaska, and British Columbia), Northern California (Northern California and the majority of Nevada), Southern California (Southern California and Hawaii), The Southwest (Arizona, New Mexico, and the Las Vegas area of Nevada), and Rocky Mountain (Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, and Utah). This is a nice idea and it\\'s one that other magazines should consider emulating. Based on where you live or where you have an active interest, this will be the region that your issue spends its pages covering. My subscription is for the Northern California region, so I am treated each month to articles about places like San Francisco, Sacramento, Reno (Nevada), Lake Tahoe, etc.\\n\\nOne of the specialties of this magazine is food and it is common to find recipes throughout every issue. There is a special section set aside for food, but one can expect to find food articles and recipes everywhere as they read. Even the cover page of each issue features a food dish. And as you might guess, the featured recipes are generally those types of cuisine normally associated with each specific region of the west, with plenty of generic recipes thrown in to make sure everyone has something to cook.\\n\\nOne of the specialty sections of this magazine that I like is the \"Value Vacation\"- a subsection of Travel & Recreation. This section highlights a specific place to travel and then offers a day by day breakdown of things to do and places to see, with the cost for each itemized so you know exactly what to expect. The highlighted city or tourist area can be anyplace in the west and isn\\'t limited to the region that your issue covers. This section is nice because it lets you see in black & white what it will cost for a few days of budget entertainment. It reminds me of some of the television programs shown on the Travel Channel.\\n\\nAdvertisements cover about 40 to 50 percent of the pages of each issue and they are often found in bunches in the front and back and on alternating pages for much of the rest of each issue (typical for most magazines). The ads can center on all sorts of different things. Because this is a combination travel/culture/food/entertainment/home & garden/living magazine, the ads cover a wide range of products and services, from laundry detergent to credit cards to cat food.\\n\\nOverall, Sunset has proven itself an enjoyable magazine. I don\\'t live in the western United States but this region is my favorite part of the country, so it makes sense that I would find something of value in this publication. I like the photography, the personal stories, the gardening and decorating ideas, and most other aspects of this magazine. If you\\'re dead set in your ways and refuse to read about anything that deviates from your Eastern, Southern, or Midwestern lifestyle, then you may not like Sunset. But for the majority of people, Sunset has much to offer with pages and pages of eye- catching pictures and friendly articles about life in the American West.',\n",

And some of the interviews are really great, even if just to gape at how some lucky authors get to live.\\n\\nThe first issue I received was the August 2009 issue, and it had a pretty good \"Publishing Survival Guide\" in it. The interview was with Anne Tyler, and that alone was worth the price of the magazine. There\\'s also a good interview with Rick Steves (I\\'m a huge fan). Interestingly, though, they decided to put Anne Tyler on the cover instead of Rick Steves.

       "  'response': \"Writer's Digest is a magazine designed for writers and it attempts to cover many different aspects of writing in its columns and featured articles. Most every issue offers at least one interview with a famous or semi- famous author. This spotlighted author could be the author of a book, a screen writer, or some other type of author. These interviews offer some good insight into writing success and the necessary skills and sacrifices to succeed at your chosen craft.\\n\\nAside from the interviews, Writer's Digest is basically a magazine of tips and advice. One issue might talk about ways to break into the business of movie reviewing for newspapers. Another might talk about ways to make your writing more concise and less wordy. Still another article might discuss ways to overcome writer's block. The main goal of Writer's Digest is to help the reader become a better writer and, hopefully, gain an offer for a publication at some point in the future.\\n\\nOne thing that is a little different with Writer's Digest is that it doesn't contain the long list of standard monthly departments like you find in other magazines. With Writer's Digest, the departments are de-emphasized and there are only a few of them in each issue. The rest of Writer's Digest is dedicated to columns and featured articles. This format is unique and it makes Writer's Digest a good choice for those who like change and prefer to read something different in each issue.\\n\\nWriter's Digest does contain a pretty good number of advertisements, but the ads are usually for writing conferences, writing software, writing contests, or ads that encourage a visit to the magazine's own web site. Because the ads stay so focused on the subject of writing, they don't seem all that bad and they are not distracting. I know some Writer's Digest readers who actually look forward to the ads so that they can find information on the latest contests. And speaking of the magazine's web site, it seems to be an important component of the magazine because it is referenced on many pages throughout each issue.\\n\\nWriter's Digest is a pretty good magazine for writer and I like it for its advice and classified ads more than anything. The success stories can sometimes get a bit carried away and they make it look a little too easy to land a huge writing contract. It would also be nice if Writer's Digest was published monthly rather than semi- monthly. But Writer's Digest is still a good magazine for writers everywhere, with plenty of good advice and tips to help you become the writer you always knew you could be.\",\n",

The library in the April/May issue is to die for! Big windows and shelves galore.\\n\\nDwell is a magazine designed to inspire and inspire it did! Even some of the text is in color.

       "  'response': \"My mailbox overflows with magazines and among the themes, home and home- related topics are the most common. Dwell Magazine ranks as one of the better home magazines I read each month and it is one of only a few publications that I will return to throughout the month for entertainment and other purposes.\\n\\nWhat makes Dwell a unique publication is its dedication to more interesting and unusual home remodeling and rebuilding ideas. Other modern home magazines exist, but Dwell Magazine takes the idea of modern to a slightly different level than other, similar publications. With Dwell Magazine, the reader is presented with unusual homes, both on the exterior and interior, and many of them are certainly eye- catching, if nothing else. This magazine is all about homes that offer distinction and some of the design ideas are very interesting and will stick with you for a long time.\\n\\nProbably the most unique fact about Dwell Magazine is that, while it focuses on unusual and creative home design, it manages to maintain a level of livability. Other magazines that focus on unusual things- whether it's the home or something else- often take the weirdness factor to the extreme and they end up alienating most readers. But Dwell Magazine avoids making this mistake. The ideas it presents are unusual and creative, but still within the boundaries of taste and practicality.\\n\\nMagazines usually offer articles that cover a large range of topics each month, but one other interesting aspect of Dwell Magazine is that each magazine is based on a specific theme. This theme is clearly spelled out on the front cover, directly under the magazine's name, in bold letters. This is nice because you already have a good idea what to expect when you open the pages of any issue. The featured articles for the month will stick to the main theme for that particular issue.\\n\\nDwell Magazine is one of hundreds of publications that focus on the home, but it easily stands out in the pack and I rank it among my favorites in this genre. I'm not into home design on a do-it-yourself level, but I do like to look at homes and the rooms within homes and I am always open to new ideas. Dwell Magazine offers plenty of creative ideas every month and it's a good magazine to consult for home makeover plans.\",\n",

       "  'response': '\"Dwell\" is my favorite of all the design magazines I read regularly. It is a beautiful magazine with thoughtful and helpful illustrations, great articles, and interesting features. I am especially fond of the coverage of emerging trends in contemporary homes, particularly the coverage of prefab homes, culminating in the sponsorship of the \"Dwell Homes,\" which showcase outstanding contemporary prefabricated housing.\\n\\nThe advertisements are consistently relevant and interesting, and the magazine is good at keeping its edge with articles about relevant home furnishings, appliances, and other items that are frequently overlooked in other design magazines. I love the \"Modern Market\" section in the back of the magazine, dealing with unique products that are well targeted to the fan of the contemporary aesthetic. My only minor complaint is the occasional political agenda that appears in the articles, but it is relatively infrequent and confined to only a few (of a large number) of the contributors, like Pagan Kennedy. In general, though, the articles stay on topic and the editorial content is relevant and appropriately focused.\\n\\nI look forward to getting several design magazines every month, but can honestly say that \"Dwell\" is my favorite of the bunch. I highly recommend it to anyone interested in contemporary architecture or design.',\n",

With a title like \"Lucky\", there were all sorts of possibilities. It could have been about gambling, sweepstakes, or about getting lucky. I didn\\'t know it was a woman\\'s magazine, so I accepted it. And from what I can see, this magazine is one of average worth to the average person and it will appeal mostly to younger women.\\n\\nFashion covers a good amount of the magazine\\'s 200 plus pages. Beauty tips are another important area of coverage. It is also common to see samples of different products inside the pages of each issue. Things like perfume samples, shampoo, and other things can be found buried somewhere within each copy. The coverage includes casual as well as high- class clothing and beauty products, with most of it falling at the upper end of the cost scale.\\n\\nIf you can tolerate the clogging of advertisements, this magazine might be a good choice for the younger female crowd that likes to keep in- tune with the latest styles and trends. Outside of that targeted market, however, I don\\'t see much use for Lucky magazine. The photography is very good and the presentation is professional, but the magazine will likely be rated average by a large cross- section of the population.',\n",

       "  'response': \"I first encountered Girls' Life at my friend's house, an avid reader. Flipping through the magazine, I saw some good, okay, and bad features. Girls Life is targeted to ages 10-15, and it's good for those parents who feel as though their kid is too old for American Girl but still not old enough for YM, Teen People, etc. This magazine has advertisments, but not that many, and they're nothing inappropriate, just things like Smackers lip gloss or Secret deodorant.\\nI think this magazine is appropriate for the age group that it is targeted to. Girls' Life has articles about school, boys, seasonal articles about holidays, fashion, real-life, celebrities (though there isn't any gossip about who's doing what),  beauty, and other topics. I don't think you should read this magazine for it's beauty and fashion articles; try Teen Vogue or Teen People for fasion and beauty. Plus, there are quizzes, celebrity features and articles, embarrasing moments stories, advice to questions sent in by real girls, letters to the editor (of course!), and other fun features. You won't find any articles about sex and college, however.\\nMy only problem with this magazine is obviously that the editors don't know what kind of girls to put on the cover and in their fashion and beauty pages. Usually, there are regular girls on the cover, sometimes a celebrity. But the thing is, Girls' Life usually doesn't put normal girls with glasses, freckels, dark hair or skin, or non-straight hair. Most of them feed us the picture of the ideal girl: tall, blonde-haird, blue-eyed, perfect complexion, no glasses, no freckels. That can ruin a girl's self-esteem, so I suggest reading this magazine not for it's models, but for the actual content. Besides from that one problem, Girls' Life would be an okay magazine for girls age 10-15.\",\n",

       "  'response': \"Ok I'm a guy who gets the magazine for the cards because the cards that are often featured in the magazine can become hot collectibles!!!. For instance, did you know that one of Tiger Woods hottest Rookie Cards was featured in this magazine? Yep, and today that card it worth some pretty big bucks. As for the rest of the magazine, well, let me say that I like it because of the fantastic photos (photos by the way kids will love to hang up on their walls or in their lockers at school) and the superb writing. You will get interesting articles on all the popular sports including swimming, basketball, baseball, tennis, football, and gymnastics, plus you will get great bios on some of today's hottest sports stars. My buddy Kim has a son who has a subscription to the magazine and he loves it. Not only is this a fun magazine to read, but it's interesting, informative, and a great collectible!!!\",\n",

I think I have normal eyes, and yet, this font is uncomfortable to read because of its small font size.\\n\\nIn summary, I enjoy this magazine a lot, but prefer House Beautiful for its easy-to-read font size and ease of carrying (not too heavy/bulky).

They suggest for instance, that you hard boil eggs, and keep them for a week in the refrigerator (page 18, November 2003 edition). True, a week is the limit for storing hard cooked eggs, and they will not kill you, but have you ever eaten an egg that has been sitting in the fridge for seven days ? It is enough to put one off the incredible edible forever. Five days is max folks, for a decent tasting egg.\\nThe paper quality is quite good, with a matte finish, but if you want substance, and really inventive ideas, look elsewhere.',\n",

       "  'response': \"Traditional Home is a nice little magazine about home living and the many ways to make a home look great, both inside and out. This magazine takes a slightly different approach to homes when compared to others of its genre. Instead of focusing on size and modern amenities, Traditional Home directs its attention toward classic style and elegance with an up- to- date twist.\\n\\nHome decorating/improvement are the main subjects in Traditional Home and there are several departments and main features dedicated to adding a touch of classic style to your house. One article might talk about the addition of different comforters and pillows to your bedroom. Another could talk about adding antique clocks to your family room. Still another might focus on sprucing up the outside of your home by planting flowering bushes. These features and departments all have the same goal in mind: To take a plain, drab room or exterior and spice it up with some old- fashioned elegance.\\n\\nNot all of the pages in Traditional Home are dedicated to the subject of decorating. The magazine does offer a few more subject areas to make it better rounded. It is common, for example, to find an article or two about home entertainment and this is especially true around the holiday season. There are also some articles that are related to travel; e.g., travel to visit a unique antique shop or partake in a home decorating event.\\n\\nTraditional Home is a classy magazine and there are many things I like about this publication. One nice quality is that the suggestions for decorating are not comprised of items exclusively for the rich and famous, like many other, similar magazines. Yes, there are some more expensive ideas presented here but there are an equal number of less expensive ideas for both decorating and for entertaining. Another quality I like is the personal touch so common in most of the articles. Ordinary people share their personal stories about why they chose to remodel their bathroom the way they did; why they celebrate Christmas the way they do; or why they added a collection of antique art to their family room. These personal touches help make the magazine more then just a buyer's guide- they make it a magazine that is nice to read and relate to.\\n\\nOverall, Traditional Home is a nice magazine about homes, decorating, and entertaining with plenty of colorful photos that offer great interior visual appeal. It is amazing what can be done to an ordinary room with some dedicated effort, and Traditional Home aims to guide readers in this direction; helping to turn a plain, boring home into a feast for the visual senses.\",\n",

Nearly every page our son will come and tell us another \"did you know this\" fact.\\nMany topics are a two-page spread so that you can hold it open and see the whole topic at a glance -- very nice. There are also some jokes, mazes and other brief entertaining items as well.\\nThe magazine is a slick glossy around 32 pages and very nice. If you are looking for an upgrade from \"Highlights\", this would be it.',\n",

       "  'response': \"The Wine Spectator is one of those magazines designed to reassure you that you're rich or that you soon could be, all in the context of a shared love for the fruit of the vine.\\n\\nThere's lots of deadly serious material in this glossy, pleasing publication. But if you're a lover of wine who is *not* rich - the category includes this reviewer - you need to learn to take it with a sense of humor. Just enjoy the game.\\n\\nThat game includes a travelogue of the world's wine regions as well as the possibility of gaining a decent education via month-by-month reading in viticulture and wine appreciation itself. This reader is in it for the long haul - I hope to enjoy good wine at an affordable cost for the duration of this earthly slog - and the Wine Spectator is my companion along the way.\\n\\nMy job takes me out for many dinners in various parts of the world that include wine-splendored places like France, South Africa, Chile, Argentina, Australia, New Zealand and - of course - Northern California.  But with wineries now in 49 of the USA's fifty states, what's *not* a wine region these days?\\n\\nOn those business treks, I find myself out for dinner as often as not. It's personally satisfying to know just enough to order a Pinotage in Capetown, since only South Africa produces this varietal, or to opt for one of Argentina's persuasive Malbecs because they're just *that* good.  We're not talking wine snobbery here, just satisfaction at the margins of life's all too margin-less journeys.\\n\\nIf this sounds like your game, the Wine Spectator may be a worthwhile investment. Even if not, consider splitting a subscription with a colleague. That's what I do. At half the price, I get a fine magazine and avoid burdening my bookshelves with one more heavy, beautiful, pleasant magazine. Life can deal you worse.\",\n",

       "  'response': 'Wine Spectator is a good wine magazine that seeks to keep the reader informed about new wine products, wine facts and education, and wine events. This magazine is published 17 times per year, so it is available often enough that most wine lovers will have more than their fill of reading material.\\n\\nMost of the material in Wine Spectator deals with buying wine, and you can expect to find several rating lists in every issue. The editors of the magazine supply the majority of the wine ratings, so when you read that one wine earned 95 points and another only 80, you need to keep in mind that these ratings are from the perspective of people who have sampled hundreds or even thousands of different wines. And with each rating or analysis, there is often contact information, such as the name of the winery or web page, so that you can learn more and/or inquire on making a purchase.\\n\\nTo help shoppers find the wines in each issue, Wine Spectator includes a detachable card that includes the names of the different featured wines. This is a handy addition, because it eliminates the need to copy down names of wine on paper or attempt to memorize the titles. All you do is check off the wines you like on the card and take it with you to your favorite beverage store for easy reference.\\n\\nWine Spectator seems to have an obsession with lists and with outlandish proclamations. It is common to find lists like \"World\\'s 100 Greatest Pinot\" or \"The 50 Finest California Reds\". Consumers are attracted to listings, and that is probably why the magazine gave in and made lists a regular part of most issues. And it is common to find extreme statements like \"This is the best Cabernet Sauvignon on the Planet\" or \"Greatest German White Wine Ever\". The publication does this to attract attention and sell more issues, but it could get annoying to some readers.\\n\\nIn spite of these few annoyances, Wine Spectator is still a good magazine. The writers at Wine Spectator are very good, very convincing, and very persuasive. They really know wine, and it comes through in their articles and recommendations. The editors articulate themselves very well and they know just the right way to describe the different brands and styles. It all adds up to a very informative magazine publication on the world of wine.',\n",

       "  'response': 'Bottom-line: Within its 130 or so glossy pages I have found a home, a resting place from which I can gleam my needed automotive knowledge.\\n\\nLike a lot of middle-aged men I am a car guy.  I eat and drink--more or less--the elixir of horsepower, torque, RPM\\'s, painted wheels, ergonomic cockpits, and colored sheet metal.  I can recite long lists of carlines and their varying specifications.  At various times in the last five years I have subscribed to and devoured three of the nation\\'s most popular car magazines: Motor Trend, Automobile, and Car & Driver.  But, I recently gave up my subscription to Automobile and received a $5.00 off coupon from Magazines.com via e-mail; I replaced it with \"Road & Track Magazine,\" published monthly by Hachette Filipacchi Media U.S., Inc.\\n\\nLike most car magazines, \"Road & Track Magazine\" is full of glossy, colorful, pictures and serious well written articles, car comparisons, and long-term road tests, but the magazine has little to distinguish itself from its brethren.  I used to read \"Road & Track Magazine\" back in my twenties, and while the magazine has moved itself smartly into the 21st century, the basic formula that made the magazine fun and informative back in the 1980\\'s remains virtually unchanged.\\n\\n\"Road & Track Magazine\" does an excellent job of covering the national (American) and International car scene. And the reaches far-a-field to bring readers the off-beat, the exotic and the really expensive, but fear not the Chevrolet Volt\\'s, Suzuki Swift\\'s and Toyota Corolla\\'s of the world also find a place inside the glossy pages of \"Road & Track Magazine.\"  And the magazine does this is in a format that is easy to follow and extremely inviting.\\n\\nFor instance in the June 2010 issue \"Road & Track Magazine\" featured the previews/road tests of the following cars: Jaguar XJ, Audi R8 Spyder; Chevrolet Corvette ZR1 vs. Nissan GTR vs. Porsche 911 Turbo; plus a long-term test wrap-up of the Acura TL SH-AWD, as well as a features write-up on the Suzuki Swift, Mazda Demio, and Toyota iQ.  Add to these two very well written and equally as comprehensive competition articles: Electric Boogaloo -Tesla vs. Lotus, and Formula 1, Then & Now, and you have receipt for the most useful automobile magazine in the country.\\n\\nBecause of its name \"Road & Track Magazine\" does seem to cover the racing circuit more than it fellows, which would be fine if I followed Formula 1, NASCAR, and notable figures from that world, but I don\\'t so I tend to skip over those articles.\\n\\nInterspersed between these nuggets of auto knowledge are other articles that deal with esoteric but informative tidbits from the automotive arena.  For instance the same issue that brought us the above mentioned articles offered up an excellent 2-page article on the past, present and future of the spark plug!  Not exactly need to know information, but for anyone with a keen interest in the internal combustion engine--like me--this article hit the spot.\\n\\nWhen the final page is turned is \"Road & Track Magazine\" different enough from the other two car periodicals I read to renew my subscription?  In a word: no.  While I certainly enjoy reading the magazines various articles and columns there just isn\\'t enough between the glossy covers to justify renewing the subscription.  I\\'m just not into the auto racing scene and \"Road & Track Magazine\" is big into Formula 1, NASCAR and other racing related themes.\\n\\nFor raw, general automotive new \"Road & Track Magazine\" is not as good as Motor Trend, Automobile, or Car & Driver.  But with a subscription cost of only $9.97 (or less, over at Magazines.com) per year, you can afford to grab 12 issues and make up your own mind.',\n",

The only plus side to the magazine is that it features bargain prices on clothing every once in a while. The pairings of clothing they put together used to be great, very wearable for the daytime and for most people not in a fashion business. Now it seems as if they've tried to mimic the weirdness that you see in Lucky magazine.\\n\\nAnother plus is the makeup and hair section, they do a good job showing what the newest trends in makeup are with a wide range of prices and products.

The result: one page you are reading about ten best eyelash curlers, next page you are pondering the tragic fate of a female South American assassin. A radiculous combination...\\n\\nNot so with In-Style. The magazine does not make pretentions about its purpose: to educate women on what to wear NOW, how to wear it and where to buy it. There is ample advice on best beauty and hair products. The articles are always fashion/entertainment industry related, nothing too heavy duty (for that I go on CNN.com and BBC.co.uk), and convey lots of useful information. To give you an example: with winter approaching, I know I must invest in a new coat and some other warmer garb. I want to make every penny count. In the September issue I was glad to discover the article: What to Know Before You Shop. I did learn some new tips and tricks! The multitude of pictures is also inspiring: I realized with only a couple of new accessories and a new way of combining items I already own, I could create at least three brand new and fashion forward outfits! Yey for me! ;o) I am also happy to report that the magazine promotes a wide range of price points: yes, there are some \"dream\" items, like the [...]+ necklace, but they are balanced by items below the [...] mark and everything in-between.\\n\\nAnyway, I hope this magazine helps you as much as it helps me! Two other magazines you may want to try: Lucky and StyleWatch. Enjoy!',\n",

       "  'response': 'Please understand that I am only sharing my journey towards fulfilling some of my personal fitness goals and this review is only a symbol representing and acknowledging that I still have so much to learn. As per a recent confirmation phone call,I humbly admit that this current  (June 2014) magazine issue was gifted to me from a company affiliated with Capital Media as a free promotional issue. I was actually trying to figure out what fitness magazine to help me along with my goals (especially due to helping me continue my progress since losing 25 pounds after starting my current job in October 2013). I actually prayed for the best magazine to assist me in my goals and strangely enough this magazine was sent to me for free shortly afterwards.  I have in front of me the June 2014 issue which has Miranda Lambert on the front cover. On pages 55-59, she bravely shares what she went through in her weight loss journey and is compassionate for others who have more weight to lose. From my modest perspective, Miranda Lamberts interview for this issue of Womens Health is very candid and inspirational. Pages 60-62 cover some of Miranda Lamberts physical fitness techniques  (as given to her by her trainer Bill Crutchfield). Page 124 shows an interview with Seth Meyers while pages 126-127 is a juicy article written to explain why many women are secretly bad girls. There are also some recipes for grilling on pages 167-171.',\n",

       "  'response': \"I have several magazines that I consult for my reading enjoyment and/or enlightenment. With most of them, I thumb through and focus only on articles that seem interesting, but there are a few magazines that seem to hit the mark so consistently that I read the almost the entire issue month after month. One good example of the latter is Archaeology Magazine.\\n\\nWhat sets this magazine apart from most others is the content itself. Yes, there are some cool illustrations but where Archaeology Magazine shines is with the articles themselves. They are packed full of fascinating information and they enrich your knowledge of history. And I don't mean refresh your knowledge- I mean enrich, because much of what you read here is going to involve historical facts you likely never heard before. I come away from every issue learning something brand new about a specific era in world history and the cultures that lived and thrived during that time.\\n\\nArchaeology Magazine has very few advertisements. Most of them are clustered at the end of each issue, so you get uninterrupted reading from start to finish. Another thing I love is that most of the articles are not excessively long. Some are only a half- page or less. At most, they might cover four pages tops. I like this, because Im the type who may not want to commit to a long, say, 10 page magazine article. I read some magazine with long articles like this and the moment I see that its going to be this long- and I always check before I start reading- I often skip the article completely.\\n\\nYet another reason to love Archaeology Magazine is the quality of the writing. The editors make sure each article is clear and concise, with proper grammar and clarity. The articles are educational and they maintain an academic style. Youre not going to find much in the way of humor or other creative forms of non- fiction prose. No, Archaeology Magazine sticks with the facts and presents them in and informative way that archaeology and history enthusiasts will appreciate.\\n\\nI usually skim through most magazines, but Archaeology Magazine is different. It is one of the very few magazines that maintain my interest from beginning to end, with every article worthy of a read. Try this magazine for yourself, and get enlightened on the fascinating world we live in and all of its glorious past.\",\n",

In the June/July issue, ideas for picnics include shopping lists and recipes for Melon Skewers with Orange-Lime Marinade. Roy Yamaguchi cooks at home with his family and offers recipes like Miso Cod with Buttered Mushrooms.\\n\\nWhat I like most about this magazine is the realistic recipes complete with everyone cooking and enjoying life. The pictures are spontaneous and the series of pictures for the Ice Cream Cake are step-by-step heaven. Just when you think this magazine has everything you could wish for, an Everyday Menu Planner appears to give recipes and shopping lists. Grilled Shrimp with Cucumber Salad and Smoked Turkey Panini are must-have recipes for the summer. Peaches resting on a marshmallow meringue are perfect for dessert after the Baby Back Ribs with Jammy Glaze.\\n\\nThis is a magazine about cooks, chefs and Rachael\\'s recipes. The \"Ask Rachael\" section gives you a chance to send in e-mails to ask Rachael about her life or to have your foodie question answered in the magazine. She also has decorating advice so now you know what to do with the shells you collected at the beach (or you could find them at Pier 1).\\n\\nWhat is the best feature in this magazine besides the recipes? \"What is in the refrigerator of your favorite Celeb?\" I\\'m always intrigued.\\n\\nIf you collect cookbooks, there are many featured in this inspired magazine.

The beauty and fashion tips attempt to mirror Vogue and Marie Claire, but the editors lose sight of the fact that teen and twentysomething age groups rarely have that kind of disposable income, and neither do most of the forty-somethings who remember growing up with Cosmo in the 70s and 80s.\\n\\nThe featured articles are still good, though, and the beauty and fashion are worth a look.\",\n",

       "  'response': '\"Food Network Magazine\" is my favorite culinary periodical. I am a fan of some of the celebrity chefs on Food Network, and this magazine is good on covering them in interviews and showcasing their recipes and cooking techniques. The magazine is very hefty and is printed on high quality glossy stock; that combined with the first class photography inside makes readers motivated to improve their cooking game and try their hand at new dishes and methods.\\n\\nI\\'m a dedicated follower of Alton Brown, whose culinary creativity and methodologies are singularly amazing, and also love the food from Bobby Flay, Michael Symon, and Aarn Snchez (whose knowledge and use of spices and particularly peppers is without peer.) Honestly there are few of the chefs who I don\\'t enjoy hearing from, and most issues are worth a solid cover to cover perusal. I like the visual elements of the magazine: the \"Recipe Index\" has a page number and photo of all the dishes in an issue, and the \"Star Search\" feature has pictures of the celebrities in an issue with the pages they appear on. There are many routine features that I love, but none as much as the well-illustrated recipes section. I particularly enjoy the \"You Asked\" section where the star chefs answer reader questions: sometimes these tips can prove extremely useful.\\n\\nI gave the magazine five stars though there are a few things less than perfect. The magazine, like most similar publications, has a ton of advertising, though much of it is relevant and unobjectionable. Each issue has a theme: normally this theme is a welcome centering device, but sometimes it is excessive as are some of the features. A recent edition had more coverage of deviled eggs than anyone could ever want (and I like deviled eggs,) while some of the articles are of little practical use (I\\'m not interested in Penn Jillette\\'s colorful kitchen, for instance, though I am sure some readers are.) Regardless of these quibbles, I still greatly enjoy \"Food Network Magazine\" and look forward to every new issue. I recommend it to cooks (of all experience levels) and fans of Food Network everywhere.',\n",

       "  'response': \"I have been subscribing to The Food Network Magazine,(FNM) for almost a year now.  Down through the years I have subscribed to several cooking magazines, and for one reason or another have eventually let them drop.  Every one I know, or have subscribed too were bi monthly magazines that mostly contained some cute little departments in them that were fun to read, but mostly a whole lot of recipes.  True recipe magazines aren't a bad thing if you enjoy just holding something in your hand the old fashioned way, but if its really recipes only your after, the online world is absolutely infested with huge sites where that is all they have and do.  I just never felt I got enough beyond the recipes in the other magazines to ever make them worth keeping...\\n\\nFNM is a whole different periodical.  Its more like a trade journal of the food network, and culinary industry in general.  All done in a nice easy, fun to read, colorful and entertaining style.  Its like being on the inside of the food channel, back stage where for most of us that love the food network, always wish we could be in any event.  I think its pretty much safe to say if you love the food network, or just love cooking, you will find this magazine immensely entertaining.  Its full of behind the scenes glimpses of the personalities, sets, production, and operation of all the shows we love to watch, as well as interviews, informative information, and a good dose of humor as well.  It also has a nice set up of every month departments where you can ask your questions, get reviews on new books and equipment, and get loads of tips on just about every kind if food or cooking that you can imagine.  Finally, despite what some other reviewers have expressed here as it being short on recipes, FCM still packs a good number of them into every issue, (even more starting about 7 issues ago). They also spread the recipes out as to dispensing them pretty evenly among all the different stars that have shows.  Therefore if you favor a certain personality or show, you will find something from them regularly.  Personally one thing I love about this magazine as to its take on recipes is that they don't seem to concentrate so much of sweets and desserts.  Seems like every magazine and cookbook I have ever owned deems is necessary to have a whole section devoted to just desserts.  I much prefer more in the way of recipes for real food, which FNM does a good job of delivering.  The recipes I have actually gotten around to trying from its pages have all turned out to be delicious, as you might expect.\\n\\nLastly there are two others things worth mentioning if your considering subscribing to this FNM, and doing it here on Amazon.  The first is that FNM is published 10 times a year, or 3 more times than all other cooking magazines I know.  I like the fact that it comes every month but two.  (And trust me, this is a slightly over size, thick magazine, not just a thin thumb through).  Finally, I originally subscribed to this magazine through one of those subscription service sites on the web that claims to always have the lowest prices around.  I paid $18 for my subscription, and as of this writing it is still going for that price online, while here on Amazon its currently $15.  A pretty good savings for what it is.  I not only highly recommend this fun entertaining and informative magazine, but I also recommend you buy it right here on Amazon. I certainly will be when my subscription renewal comes around. I am immensely enjoying my Food Network Magazine, and I really think you will like it too...\",\n",

The magazine is more of the same.\\n\\nThere\\'s quite a few ads for gadgets and some articles that are also thinly veiled advertisements for kitchen utensils and fancy items. I understand that the magazine has to make money somehow. If you can ignore the advertisements (some obvious and others \"not so\" obvious), then I think this magazine is worth the subscription price, which is heavily discounted online.\\n\\nStill a pretty good buy and something that you don\\'t have to be embarrassed to put out on your coffee table when friends come over.',\n",

There is also a handy recipe index organized by categories at the end of the magazine.\\n\\nThe Kids recipe section encourages young cooks to participate in family meals.

In the June/July issue, ideas for picnics include shopping lists and recipes for Melon Skewers with Orange-Lime Marinade. Roy Yamaguchi cooks at home with his family and offers recipes like Miso Cod with Buttered Mushrooms.\\n\\nWhat I like most about this magazine is the realistic recipes complete with everyone cooking and enjoying life. The pictures are spontaneous and the series of pictures for the Ice Cream Cake are step-by-step heaven. Just when you think this magazine has everything you could wish for, an Everyday Menu Planner appears to give recipes and shopping lists. Grilled Shrimp with Cucumber Salad and Smoked Turkey Panini are must-have recipes for the summer. Peaches resting on a marshmallow meringue are perfect for dessert after the Baby Back Ribs with Jammy Glaze.\\n\\nThis is a magazine about cooks, chefs and Rachael\\'s recipes. The \"Ask Rachael\" section gives you a chance to send in e-mails to ask Rachael about her life or to have your foodie question answered in the magazine. She also has decorating advice so now you know what to do with the shells you collected at the beach (or you could find them at Pier 1).\\n\\nWhat is the best feature in this magazine besides the recipes? \"What is in the refrigerator of your favorite Celeb?\" I\\'m always intrigued.\\n\\nIf you collect cookbooks, there are many featured in this inspired magazine.

       "  'response': 'Details is much less indepth / informative as GQ or Esquire.  The articles are shorter in length and not as journalistic. Articles are more about lifestyles and less about sports / women and cars.  With reveiews that are typically a few paragraphs long.  The magazine itselfs seems geared towards a younger male and a more metrosexual lifestyle. The price is right and for $10 it a great investment as you most likely find a few things each month of interest.',\n",

       "  'response': 'Details is a mildly interesting magazine that is geared toward men of various ages and lifestyles. The main group that Details aims to capture is the 17 to 35 year- old male but there are articles in each magazine that could be appealing to men of many different ages, mostly in the middle to upper income groups.\\n\\nSome things about Details quickly set it apart from other magazines. One difference is the \"departments\". Most magazines have departments, but instead of talking about the same things each month, these departments vary in their content (the only exceptions being \"Know- Tell\" and the \"The Details\"). Each one contains similar stories from one month to the next, but with different subtitles, helping to make each issue a little fresher than it would otherwise be.\\n\\nAs far as the writing goes, Details offers a great deal of diversity for a magazine. Yes, it is generally focused on things of interest to men, but it covers a very broad range of interests. You can find articles in this magazine on such diverse topics as the death penalty, raising kids, buying a new coat, setting up an internet business, breaking up with a girlfriend, or purchasing the best vodka. There are articles geared toward single men and married men, as well as younger men and middle- aged men.\\n\\nI like some of the articles found here but there is one problem I have with the writing in Details. It is common to find eye- catching headlines on the cover of Details that tempt you to find out more. This is nothing new and most every magazine does this. But the problem is that many of these eye- popping stories fail to keep you amazed when you read them. Take for example an article in a recent issue. On the front, it reads \"Is Your Wife a Bad Mom\"? It sound like an engaging, intellectual read. But once you find the article and take in its 1,000+ words, you quickly discover that there is little or no substance. Basically, it simply tells men that accusing your wife of being a bad mom is a risky undertaking that could hurt her feelings. That is it. There is no intellectual analysis or quotes from studies; only the bottom line conclusion that mothers generally don\\'t like to be called incompetent by their husbands. Other headlining articles in this magazine lead to similar disappointment.\\n\\nThe writing in this magazine is on the edge and very blunt. It is common to find several four- letter words in many of the articles and while this doesn\\'t bother me at all, I know that some readers will consider it too raw, too edgy, and too explicit. Details writers have no problem telling it like it is, and this can be both good and bad depending on one\\'s perspective.\\n\\nBesides the language, some parts of this magazine could offend certain readers; namely the \"Anthropology\" page at the end. This closing \"article\" is meant to be humorous, but some readers will not see it that way. I don\\'t know if it has always been this way, but what \"Anthropology\" does is show a person or multiple people and then asks the question \"Gay or ______\". For example, I have seen titles like \"Gay or Best Friends?\", \"Gay or Cowboy?\", \"Gay or Neo Punk Rocker?\", and others. With each of these, there is a diagram of sorts with arrows pointing to different clothing and bodily features and short comments about each one. Basically, it is asking you to think about these different attributes of the person or people in the picture and then decide if the way they dress, look, and act makes them gay. I find this silly and immature, but I can see how some readers would find it insulting. I don\\'t know if Details has always done this or if the Anthropology page has been different in the past. But this is how it has been in every issue I have read and it needs to be changed.\\n\\nAdvertisements claim about sixty percent of the pages in each issue of this magazine. They cover products like liquor, cars, electronics, cigarettes, fragrance, etc. Even though this magazine covers lots of different things, the item most often featured in the advertisements is clothing. The magazine seems to have a penchant for high fashion and it devotes more pages to expensive clothing than anything else. And each issue often has its own unique smell, thanks to all of the cologne samples. You can flip through the pages and find several samples in each issue, with many of the latest and trendiest scents from the biggest names in cologne.\\n\\nOverall, I am torn between liking or not liking Details Magazine. I like some of the articles on food, drink, politics and the like. But I don\\'t necessarily like the shallow fluff that is often substituted for an intellectual discussion and I can understand how some readers would find certain aspects of this magazine insulting. This magazine is deserving of only about two and one- half stars which I will round up to three stars and give a small recommendation. Some will like this magazine and some will not. It\\'s all a matter of what you like to read about and whether or not you can handle a magazine that pushes the envelope.',\n",

Bland ones... I buy fashion magazines for the pictures: I may not buy all the clothes, but at least I want to be informed what is current and can figure out how to emulate the looks.

       "  'response': 'Bottom-Line: I have come to the conclusion the \"Men\\'s Health\" is not written for me.\\n\\nThe world of men\\'s magazines is festooned with glossy covers adorned with half dressed woman and mostly vapid content geared toward the more Neanderthal and or juvenile among us.  In a world filled with Maxim and Stuff magazines, \"Men\\'s Health\" magazine stands out as a periodical with some substance, style and intellect, but after reading the latest issue I am certainly not sold.  And what is with all of the lists?\\n\\nI had been meaning to pick up an issue of \"Men\\'s Health Magazine\" for quite some time when I picked up a copy--the October 2007 issue--while shopping for a computer manual at Borders.  The cover--as they always tend to do--featured a rather buff Jason Statham and article titles in big bold letters designed to catch the attention of that man looking for advise on Six-Pack ABS, or how to Dress for More Sex, or how to Eat Better and Think Smarter, or (my favorite) read what 1,293 Sexy Women Confess What They Want in Bed.\\n\\n\"Men\\'s Health Magazine,\" whose tag line is Tons of Useful Stuff, was founded in 1987 and is published 10 times a year by the Rodale Inc.  The magazine began publishing in the United Kingdom in 1995.  Today \"Men\\'s Health Magazine\" is published in 36 editions worldwide, distributed to 48 countries, and enjoyed a (2005) U.S. circulation of some 1.8 million.\\n\\nThe problem with \"Men\\'s Health\" is that there is very little useful information to be found with the fold of the magazine despite it daunting size.  Most of the articles are snippets of information stuck between far too many glassy advertisements featuring young male models in clothing I would never wear and probably couldn\\'t afford.  Same for the automobiles.  To be sure there was one rather lengthy article in the issue I read, but it was about dogs of all things!  The article I wanted to have some substance--a snippet on Michelle Ryan, the new Bionic Woman--was barely a page in length; how disappointing.\\n\\nAnd yes there was a snippet or two about healthy food, but nothing I didn\\'t already know.  And the lists, there are endless lists of thing we can do to improve this or that, mostly dealing with self-image and sex; there are very few actually devoted to well, men\\'s health.  Has our attention span grown so short that we must now condense or leisure reading into bullet points; endless lists that tell us how to live our lives?\\n\\nI have come to the conclusion the \"Men\\'s Health\" is not written for me, a man in the middle of his life, settled, with a family, a regular job, with far too little time work workout, and far too little money to afford the rich life-style pimped by the magazine.  There is little practical information inside the glossy innards of \"Men\\'s Health\" at least from my perspective.  Perhaps if I were young, rich, hip, the magazine would appeal to me, but I am none of those things, so...By the way what is the deal with all the lists?  Oh I already asked that question, I am still waiting for an answer.',\n",

I feel some of the stories are stupid.  I still will pick up my sister's Seventeen magazine to see what they have to say and it is amazing how stupid we are trying to make our girls!  A couple of the articles that really fueled me were:  there was a girl who wore short (nasty) skirts to the mall and someone took a picture up her skirt.  When asked what she wears to the mall she answered the SAME THING!  She just wanted attention...that is one reason girls have problems.  Another one was a girl who wore lingerie online and was upset over men-and still has the website!  GET REAL!  What is wrong with the world when these are two of the stories that were main ones in the magazine?!?!  What are girls to learn?  Dress like a skank and get treated like one but continue it?  I don't know about this magazine anymore...I guess it is moving with the times?!  But, my sister still reads it mostly for horoscopes and the music/actors/actresses articles.

       "  'response': 'Bottom-line: While \"US Weekly\" is fine for the undemanding and tedious world of the treadmill, I would not read the magazine on continual basis; there is just not enough substance.\\n\\nThe New Year brought a new commitment to fitness; Yeah!  But no, this time I\\'m serious about want to shed a few pounds and lighten the load on my poor knees.  Of course this mean a copious amount of time on the treadmill shedding those unwanted pound, listening to Christina Aguilera and reading \"US Weekly Magazine,\" which my gym seems to have an over abundance of to the exclusion of any other periodical.\\n\\nI am not usually given to reading entertainment magazines; I would hate to think of myself as a celebrity hound, but \"US Weekly\" is short on words and long on pictures and advertising; in other words just right for the treadmill machine where my attention is not ripe for reading.  Unlike Entertainment Weekly, or even People, \"US Weekly\" does not pretend to be serious, the magazine does not attempt to cloth itself in the veneer of serious journalism.  \"US Weekly\", which is published, well weekly, is little more than a thin picture book full of the minutiae of celebrity life.\\n\\nThere are no articles in \"US Weekly\", at least not anything that would pass as an article in say Entertainment Weekly, or People; there are instead picture captions and the occasion short write-up (a paragraph or two) on this star or that, or those stars over there.  \"US Weekly\" is just a tad more reputable than say The National Enquirer or Star Magazine, but just barely.  For example, the February 19, 2007 issues\\' cover featured a colorful full page picture of Reese Witherspoon beside a headline that read Hollywood\\'s Revenge Diets! Better after breakup!  How newly single stars get slim and sexy fast.  Meanwhile a sidebar featured Jennifer Aniston and Jessica Simpson under a title which read Plastic Surgery!  Jennifer was a \"Winner!\" while poor Jessica was \"Scary!\" after her sojourn under the knife.\\n\\nRegular sections in the magazine include:\\n\\no Hot Hollywood\\no Hot Pics\\no Features\\no News\\no Style\\no In Every Issue\\n\\nBut lack of depth does not prevent the mainstream advertisers from calling; indeed there is an advertisement--mostly courting a female audience--almost every other page.  This is not out of line with other magazines in this genre, although \"US Weekly\" is the only magazine I know of that does not have a masthead.  Based on the advertising and editorial content this is a magazine designed and published for young women.  And that is not to imply that young women are shallow and unfocused on self; I make the statement because there are a lot of (female) style and fashion photos contained therein, along with a fair amount of make-up advertisements.  This is not normally (straight) \"guy\" territory.\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nWhile \"US Weekly\" is fine for the undemanding and tedious world of the treadmill, I would not read the magazine on continual basis; there is just not enough substance.  And while I have to admit that (women) celebrities intrigue me, I would rather not read a whole magazine devoted to their every step; \"US Weekly\" is not for me.',\n",

It's one of those magazines that will come into great use when you're bored and want something interesting yet light to read, and if you're celebrity obsessed, you'll definitely LOVE this one. My main problem with it is that everytime I pick up an issue, I feel like I'm stalking these celebs. In their August 30 issue, they had a two-page spread showing Jessica Simpson shopping at a grocery store, loading them into her car, and even pulling her dress back up. I don't know about you, but I felt as though that was completely unnescesary. The magazine is big on these things, like showing Britney Spears eating lunch and Paris and Nikki Hilton walking on the beach. It gets very annoying sometimes. However, some of the stuff they talk about is interesting, and I enjoy the fashion and beauty sections.

       "  'response': \"I am not really big on celebrity magazines that are really tabloids but with glossy pages like People magazine but I must admit to having a soft spot for US Weekly. Yeah it is pure fluff and nothing to be taken remotely seriously however I get my kicks out of some of the articles that are published there. My biggest beef with the rag is that in the latest issue of US Weekly, it only gives a paragraph each to the passings of Johnny Cash and John Ritter who had passed away two weeks ago while they do an entire bloody article on Bennifer Afflopez, the most overexposed and overrated celebrity couple on this entire planet. I found that quite distasteful. Even that tabloid People Magazine gave a couple of pages to both celebrities. What is just as gross is seeing really unattractive celebs in their bathing suits (i.e Avril Lavigne and her guitar player). However I do love the best & worst dressed pages in the back. I love the snide remarks from the weekly guests. I don't care who is the best dressed, it is who is wearing the ugliest outfits that I care. Another celebrity couple I could live without seeing in the pages of US Weekly for the rest of my life...Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston. Oh lordy. The two most boring celebrities known to mankind. And their acting isn't anything to write home about either. If anything, US Weekly makes for good reading material in the bathroom, otherwise it ain't serious journalism that's for sure.\",\n",

You can tell that every article is well-researched and no feature in the magazine is an afterthought.  In every issue, you will find:\\n- stories about the unsung heroes who are really responsible for pushing the limits of technology\\n- some politically-oriented article that shows the growing interplay between technology and politics\\n- cool digital and electronic gadgets (that usually cost a lot of $$)\\n- fun stuff like Jargon watch, Wired vs. Tired, and even some of the ads (how often can you say that?)\\nBeyond that, I find Wired is the best place to read about things like the melding of human and computer and the progess of technology outside of the U.S.  So, I find every issue interesting.  It's a little less useful to me as an investor in technology stocks, but it does offer me that broader perspective on technology that helps put investable ideas into context.  The clincher is the price - a small sacrifice for so much intriguing and entertaining content.  I once considered discontinuing my subscription, but realized that it's so different from everything else I read and just one decent article an issue makes it worthwhile.  Very glad I kept it.  So, if you've never read Wired, I would give it definitely give it a try.\",\n",

       "  'response': 'I have been a subscriber to Runner\\'s World Magazine for the past four years.  I have watched, in dismay, the slow and sure descent of this magazine into the clutches of marketers.  Let me give you an example:\\n\\nRunner\\'s World April 2013.\\nPage 46.  Magazine recommends eggs in an added on box in the bottom right corner of the page.\\nPage 67.  Magazine recommends eggs again stating that studies (which studies?) show that eating eggs helps reduce calorie intake.  Large picture of a fried egg.  Also several recipes recommend eggs (on the same page).\\nPage 45.  Paid advertisement for egg whites.\\n\\nPage 31.  Magazine recommends chocolate milk as an after workout recovery (gross!)\\nPage 67.  Magazine has picture of milk cartons, recommend fat free milk.\\nPage 74.  Magazine recommends chocolate milk again.  With picture this time.\\nPage 39.  Paid advertisement for chocolate milk.\\n\\nSeeing a trend?  It\\'s sad really, because where is the line going to be drawn?  I don\\'t mind the advertisements, but when the magazine starts working in recommendations based on what ads have been bought a particular month?  Will Runner\\'s World recommend M&Ms as a post run recovery if Mars Candy Company puts in an add?  Granted chocolate milk and eggs aren\\'t the worst... but seriously recommending eggs for a runner to lose weight?  Should we ignore the cholesterol and fat content?  Again, just picking on one thing, but I can see a trend starting to develop.\\n\\nThat alone wouldn\\'t be enough to completely turn me off the magazine though.  The ads have gotten more numerous it seems, and actual content has shrunk.  More of the content is being devoted to recipes and repetitive training tips.  Great for those who buy this magazine on occasion from the new stand, but not for subscribers.  The beginners\\' tips are getting so repetitive that I can predict exactly what will be recommended:\\n> Start out slow.\\n> Interval train.\\n> Post run stretch.\\n> Take days off when needed.\\n> Slowly add mileage.\\n> Back off if too sore or injured or strained.\\n\\nAlso, the rave run section at the beginning?  A big glossy picture of a cool location I probably won\\'t be able to run.  Newbie chronicles?  The stories can be humorous, but are usually just a recap of an run that a beginner took that inspired them to run more often.  There are usually a few recipes, but often they are geared towards meat eaters and don\\'t have any really easy way to modify them for vegetarians or vegans.  I did see one recipe where the author mentioned subbing tofu and another ingredient to make it vegan.  But this is rare.  The shoe reviews have become a joke.  Basically you can expect several shoes to get \\'awards\\' or a \\'best update\\', but often they are incomplete comparisons and they do not have the user notes any longer.  (They used to include a few lines from testers about what they liked, now they just have one or two lines by testers per guide, not per shoe).\\n\\nThe best section?  \"Ask Miles.\"\\n\\nAlso, periodically there are very good and inspiring stories.  But a lot of the stories are fluff.  It\\'s just not worth a subscription anymore.  I bought the following book for cheap - MUCH cheaper than Runner\\'s World was trying to sell it directly to subscribers for:&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Runner-s-World-Complete-Book-of-Running-Everything-You-Need-to-Run-for-Weight-Loss-Fitness-and-Competition/dp/1605295795/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Runner\\'s World Complete Book of Running: Everything You Need to Run for Weight Loss, Fitness, and Competition</a>.  $15 brand new from Amazon.  The magazine e-mailed me a trial offer for this book with the final billed amount at $35.  Sad.  But my recommendation?  Until the magazine gets back to where it was 2+ years ago, skip it.  If you really want packed information about running and training, buy the book I mentioned.  At least it\\'s ad free!\\n\\nMy recommendation?  Stick to running gear ads and get away from food product ads, I think that is an area that makes money but also puts the magazine at the liberty of some of the most unscrupulous advertisers in the country (remember, food companies often pay grocery stores for better shelf space and for their products to be featured in ads and circulars).  I would also revamp the rave run section and have several (smaller) pictures of at least a dozen locations each month scattered around the country.  You could even ask readers to send in pictures and locations.  Give us a slice instead of blowing up one giant photo.  And with a selection, perhaps one of these runs might be close by.  Also have more stories and information for mid level runners.  More product reviews - the earbud reviews were nice, but there were only six or so.  That is not acceptable.  Give us 20+ earbuds and just list the ones that aren\\'t recommended.  And try buying the products out of the budget rather than having vendors give them to the magazine.  I understand that is the nature of the game: \"want it reviewed?  Give it to us.\"  But often this makes incomplete review guides.\\n\\nI don\\'t want Runner\\'s World to go the route Outside Magazine did several years ago.  Remember the readers and the runners are #1, not advertisers.  Give the magazine the old substance and pay attention to subscribers.  Don\\'t sacrifice the quality overall just to appeal to those folks browsing the magazine rack at Barnes and Noble.  I have another year or so left on my subscription (silly 2 year renewal!), hopefully I will see a nice improvement in that time.  And I don\\'t think I\\'m alone in this.',\n",

       "  'response': 'Maxim is a monthly publication aimed at the younger male population, aged 16 to 30. This magazine offers a few amusing tidbits each month, like jokes and unusual ways to make things. There is an occasional fashion article, and some monthly articles on electronic gadgets and music. But the primary reason why people buy Maxim and the main reason it sells as well as it does is the women.\\nMaxim is not really an adult magazine, like Playboy or Penthouse. Its photographs do not expose so much that they should garner an X rating. But many of them come very close. From the picture on the cover (always a young woman, often with a seductive look in her eyes and much flesh exposed) to the photos in the middle, Maxim uses sex to sell. It isn\\'t strictly a photo- op magazine for young women. There are interviews to accompany the visual effects. But the small talk is almost always geared toward sex- how to get it, how to keep getting it for a long time, how to improve your chances to get it, how to help friends get it, how to turn women on, etc.\\nThe photos in Maxim are enticing, and I don\\'t think any red- blooded American male would deny this fact. But what hurts Maxim a little bit and what keeps it from gaining as much respect as it could have is the monthly dose of stupidity that comes with each issue. Much of what you find in the \"How to\" section, for example, is idiotic and I cannot imagine anyone taking it seriously. The \"Bar Exam\" feature is also bordering on stupidity, with a set of trivia questions each month about some type of useless information.\\nOverall, I think Maxim is at least an average magazine, in spite of its flaws. Yes, many of the articles are brainless and the humor is the type that would amuse a 12- year old. But the main reason people buy and read (or should I say look) at Maxim is the photographs of the women. With so much flesh exposed, without going to far, Maxim is a publication with a purely visual bend. You won\\'t find much intelligence here, but you will find plenty of photos of scantily clad women, tempting your hormones with their youthful good looks and uninhibited personalities.',\n",

They don't even mind a little bit of education and learning as long as it is entertaining in some way. This is why kids' magazines are often so visual and colorful and National Geographic kids is, as expected, a publication loaded with pictures and bright colors. The magazine is focused mainly on animals, but also includes material on science, geography, technology, etc.\\n\\nMy girls are big fans of several kids' magazines and they look forward to receiving issues in the mail each month. I like most of them, due to their educational value. But I must take exception to National Geographic Kids magazine. This publication does contain some educational material, but the problem is that the education is minimal, with the remaining pages covered with meaningless fluff and advertisements. The ads are especially annoying because National Geographic Kids intermingles the ads into what seems like an educational article. It is done in a subtle way that you may not even notice at first.\\n\\nNational Geographic Kids attempts to break up the educational material with trivia, some photographs, and a few other things, but they are not items I would expect to see in a publication that is supposed to be aimed at children in the later elementary school age years and that is supposed to educate. It is also surprising how thin the magazine is- it seems more like a thick newsletter than a magazine publication.\\n\\nNational Geographic itself is a great magazine and I am very surprised that such a quality publication would permit its name to be scarred by the likes of this magazine. It could be so much better with a little work. It isn't like National Geographic doesn't have the resources to make improvements. They have the expertise and the know- how to make a quality kids magazine, but seem content with this publication in its present form, in spite of its many flaws.\\n\\nKids magazines are plentiful and there are some really good publications available that help teach kids about different subjects in an entertaining way. National Geographic Kids, unfortunately, isn't one of them. The worthwhile material can be isolated to about one- third of the magazine's limited pages and the overall educational value is minimal.

I grew up in the mid-west, where for most people considering we are surrounded by corn fields and our communities are filled with farmers, comfort is more important than fashion. You are more likely to see farm and home stores than fashion stores. Anyway, this was only $5 so I took a chance on ordering it along with several other magazines (which I have a surplus of and am currently behind on reading lol) and this is one of the only ones that even though it is only $5, I had to cancel even if they didn't refund me. I just did not want this coming to my house every month. It is a thick magazine which is good and bad, but one issue was like an encyclopedia. When I started flipping through the pages, MOST of it was ads for products and designers. Just women posing in silly clothes and makeup. The articles, to me, were boring, bland, and not relevant to my life or interests. I read one article where a woman struggled with her appearance because she was Jewish and had a big nose and whatever and it made me kinda sad that she couldn't accept herself for such a long time. Everyone is beautiful in different ways and magazines like ELLE present a culture of one kind of beauty which really isn't beautiful. It's fake and kind of scary. So I just did not want this magazine in my house. I am sticking with more down to earth magazines. I enjoy a range of health magazines, home and family magazines, and girly magazines that aren't quite so fashion centered. Again, this is my opinion so please don't criticize me. I understand location has a lot to do with how you view fashion and body image but I am perfectly happy with me!\\n\\nUpdate: I'm glad some people are finding my review helpful! I also forgot to mention that my mom (a woman in her 50's) exchanges magazines with me and this magazine has very small print which made the magazine hard for her to read. And I flipped through the last issue I received and most of the articles (at the end of the magazine since the first half of it is full of ads) were about feminism. I am not a feminist and that's as far as I'll go on that subject. You can formulate your own opinion of the articles. Just pointing it out to potential subscribers since I had no idea what to expect from this magazine. Another article in this magazine was defending photo shop and feeding false body images to women as artwork like it is no big deal! I was shocked because it contributes to eating disorders and low self esteem in many women, especially young women. A better name for this magazine would be SUPERFICIAL.\",\n",

       "  'response': \"I love traveling, both in the U.S. and internationally and when I received an invite to subscribe to National Geographic Traveler a few years ago, I gladly I've always enjoyed reading the regular National Geographic. I liked the look and content of this magazine and subscribed for three years twice. In a month my subscripiton will come to an end and I doubt I will renew. The quality and quanitity of the magazine has dropped quickly over the last few months. The pages have noticeably been fewer and more advertisements seem to fill most of the pages now.  It just isn' the same magazine that I paid for nearly three years before. As with other magazines of late, I have noticed a disturbing and unsatifactory trend: the quality is going downhill and the magazine has lost about 20 pages. There seems to be a trend out there, sadly, not just with this magazine, and I can't be the only one that notices it, but over the last year or so, some of my favorite magazines have cut down on the amount of pages in each issue and it is noticeable when you handle the issue. I know the economy is in a sh-t, but I did pay in advance for a certain magazine. Suddenly, all these magazines are shrinking the issues without any notice what so over to the subscriber. And they expect to keep us when the price remains the same for less of the magazine. I just don't know. I have noticed that Amazon price beats the price directly offered by the magazine itself and I don't get that. Hopefully, nat Geo Traveler will go back to where it was, though I doubt it, if people are willing to contiually pay the same $$ for less pages, why should they? For this reason, this is another magazine I will not renew. You'd think the publishers would want to keep the subscribers they do have, but they don't. I know because I have contacted editors of a few magazines: Smart Computing for one and the editor first asked me what I missed. When I told him, he couldn't care less. What a bad attitude! Needless to say, I cancelled my three year subscription and received a refund, only partial because they wanted to keep all my money. How do you like that? All I can say is think carefully now before you subscribe to any magazine. I know I am.\",\n",

Then Men\\'s Health itself started changing into something boring and bland and my boyfriend chose to end his subscription.  Now, it seems like the same pattern is emerging with Women\\'s Health.  It went strong for awhile, but now it just feels like they\\'re regurgitating the same information over and over.\\n\\nIt\\'s not so much that Women\\'s Health is a *bad* magazine.

But no, this time I\\'m serious about want to shed a few pounds and lighten the load on my poor knees.  Of course this mean a copious amount of time on the treadmill shedding those unwanted pound, listening to Christina Aguilera and reading \"US Weekly Magazine,\" which my gym seems to have an over abundance of to the exclusion of any other periodical.\\n\\nI am not usually given to reading entertainment magazines; I would hate to think of myself as a celebrity hound, but \"US Weekly\" is short on words and long on pictures and advertising; in other words just right for the treadmill machine where my attention is not ripe for reading.  Unlike Entertainment Weekly, or even People, \"US Weekly\" does not pretend to be serious, the magazine does not attempt to cloth itself in the veneer of serious journalism.  \"US Weekly\", which is published, well weekly, is little more than a thin picture book full of the minutiae of celebrity life.\\n\\nThere are no articles in \"US Weekly\", at least not anything that would pass as an article in say Entertainment Weekly, or People; there are instead picture captions and the occasion short write-up (a paragraph or two) on this star or that, or those stars over there.  \"US Weekly\" is just a tad more reputable than say The National Enquirer or Star Magazine, but just barely.  For example, the February 19, 2007 issues\\' cover featured a colorful full page picture of Reese Witherspoon beside a headline that read Hollywood\\'s Revenge Diets! Better after breakup!  How newly single stars get slim and sexy fast.  Meanwhile a sidebar featured Jennifer Aniston and Jessica Simpson under a title which read Plastic Surgery!  Jennifer was a \"Winner!\" while poor Jessica was \"Scary!\" after her sojourn under the knife.\\n\\nRegular sections in the magazine include:\\n\\no Hot Hollywood\\no Hot Pics\\no Features\\no News\\no Style\\no In Every Issue\\n\\nBut lack of depth does not prevent the mainstream advertisers from calling; indeed there is an advertisement--mostly courting a female audience--almost every other page.  This is not out of line with other magazines in this genre, although \"US Weekly\" is the only magazine I know of that does not have a masthead.  Based on the advertising and editorial content this is a magazine designed and published for young women.  And that is not to imply that young women are shallow and unfocused on self; I make the statement because there are a lot of (female) style and fashion photos contained therein, along with a fair amount of make-up advertisements.  This is not normally (straight) \"guy\" territory.\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nWhile \"US Weekly\" is fine for the undemanding and tedious world of the treadmill, I would not read the magazine on continual basis; there is just not enough substance.  And while I have to admit that (women) celebrities intrigue me, I would rather not read a whole magazine devoted to their every step; \"US Weekly\" is not for me.',\n",

My main problem with it is that everytime I pick up an issue, I feel like I'm stalking these celebs.

I don't know about you, but I felt as though that was completely unnescesary. The magazine is big on these things, like showing Britney Spears eating lunch and Paris and Nikki Hilton walking on the beach. It gets very annoying sometimes.

Yeah it is pure fluff and nothing to be taken remotely seriously however I get my kicks out of some of the articles that are published there. My biggest beef with the rag is that in the latest issue of US Weekly, it only gives a paragraph each to the passings of Johnny Cash and John Ritter who had passed away two weeks ago while they do an entire bloody article on Bennifer Afflopez, the most overexposed and overrated celebrity couple on this entire planet. I found that quite distasteful. Even that tabloid People Magazine gave a couple of pages to both celebrities. What is just as gross is seeing really unattractive celebs in their bathing suits (i.e Avril Lavigne and her guitar player). However I do love the best & worst dressed pages in the back. I love the snide remarks from the weekly guests. I don't care who is the best dressed, it is who is wearing the ugliest outfits that I care. Another celebrity couple I could live without seeing in the pages of US Weekly for the rest of my life...Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston. Oh lordy. The two most boring celebrities known to mankind. And their acting isn't anything to write home about either. If anything, US Weekly makes for good reading material in the bathroom, otherwise it ain't serious journalism that's for sure.\",\n",

I remember the times when I looked forward to reading it, when I spent 30-60 minutes on an issue, when the valuable information (I am a movie buff, and I don't watch TV or listen to pop music) was at least 50%, when I chose the DVDs in my Netflix movie queue based on their EW score. These guys used to be that good. Not anymore.\\n\\nNowadays it's just another piece of pop garbage. My subscription ended in February, but they sent me a courtesy issue, which I have just finished reading... in the usual under 10 minutes. Jack of all trades, master of none. Full of gossip-level amateurish material. They are simply irrelevant for this generation X-er. If they continue the current trend, I foresee a fast fall into oblivion.\",\n",

       "  'response': \"The weekly bible of everything entertainment, from movies, TV, music , video games and books (among other things). I have been s subscriber for nearly 15 years and although I do not agree with many of their reviews, there is always something interesting to read in the magazine. The only thing that irks me a lot is their opinion that THE WALKING DEAD is the best TV show on the air since the invention of sliced bread. Any intellectual viewer will see that the characters come directly out of Stereotypes 101 and the plots are nothing but recycled George Romero and countless other zombie films, but they always manage to put a story or photo of the series in every issue. Whomever thought that this was the best show ever on TV really needs to watch more TV. Even the worst episode of THE X-FILES makes the best episode of THE WALKING DEAD look like the worst episode of WHO'S THE BOSS. Just because a TV show has taboo-breaking gore on it does not make it a great series. What about M*A*S*H, THE WIRE, THE SOPRANOS, ST. ELSEWHERE, OZ, JUSTIFIED, THE AMERICANS, GAME OF THRONES, AMERICAN HORROR STORY or any other good show that made or makes TV worthwhile? To EW, they are nothing but chickenfeed when put next to THE WALKING DEAD. Like I said, that is really my only complaint about the magazine, but it is enough of an annoyance whenever I see I cover on the zine devoted to the show (and there have been many!). They do have a good staff of writers and make me laugh every now and then, so I give them a pass when it comes to TWD. It's a great zine at a very affordable price if you have it renewed every year. You pay like $0.49 an issue. A real bargain.\",\n",

It\\'s a sort of a good mix of pop culture *plus* a teeny, tiny bit of gossip, but the *\"interesting\" kind, meaning- you won\\'t find out about Snooki\\'s latest drama, but you will get the scoop on how a much anticipated Hollywood franchise might be headed for trouble.\\n\\nThe best thing about EW is their coverage of upcoming movies, books, television, music, and stage, plus interesting articles on the business of entertainment- everything from in depth coverage of TV shows to an inside look at a much anticipated film to long interviews with directors, etc.\\n\\nThe only thing I don\\'t like about the magazine is that it\\'s starting to get very web and tablet focused- meaning, the content of the magazine is slowly getting leaner and leaner, and on every other page there\\'s a reminder to check the EW website or iPad edition for the rest of the features. I\\'m not happy about this- I really like it when they had about six or eight pages of movie reviews. I\\'m not happy that now it\\'s four pages of movie reviews, and two of those pages are tiny \"one sentence\" reviews and charts. It\\'s the same for books and television and other media, as well.\\n\\nRegardless, I still eagerly dive into every issue that pops into my mailbox, and out of all the magazines I start and drop subscriptions to, this is the only one I really consider \"necessary\".

Most of the fashions and cosmetics are, of course, waaayyy out of the price range of the average reader.\\n\\nThe stories are rumors you can get much cheaper via supermarket tabloids, or \"quotes\" from a \"source\" that\\'s supposedly \"close\" to the celebrity, or paragraphs of what the person \"might\" do, based on trends or what their celeb pals have done in the past.  Usually these are incorrect.  A few months ago I the magazine gushed about Princess Kate\\'s pregnancy with twins, and how Buckingham Palace \"should confirm\" it soon.  Today the cover squeals that Kate and her sister Pippa are both pregnant, Kate with a girl and Pippa with a boy.  I won\\'t hold my breath over it.\\n\\nSubscribe to US or PEOPLE if you want intelligently-written articles about celebs and others in the news.  The magazines don\\'t source stories on gossip and rumor, and are written by reliable reporters instead of paparazzi, which I suspect is the case here.

There are some tabloid style photos which are completely tasteless, and I'm not really sure who cares if Brittany Spears had a latte at Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf on 4th street last Wednesday, but mostly it's a fair gossip magazine.  The articles are all really short and definitely without much depth, but most people aren't looking for that when they read Us weekly.  The fashion police is pretty funny; it's just a bunch of comments about star's clothes from a group of people with no real authority on the subject.  Most are comedians or writers, which is probably why it's so funny.  This magazine is definitely a quick read, and I don't feel any smarter when I'm done reading it, but it does keep me up to date on the Hollywood side of pop culture.\",\n",
