       "      <th>for me, panic attacks come two ways: randomly or because of a certain trigger (e.g., feeling threatened or unsafe, worrying too much, etc). here's an account of a random one i had not long ago: imagine sitting at a cafe having lunch. you leave that cafe to head home, but feel weirdly out of breath, even a bit dizzy. you get home and have a seat and try to catch your breath, but instead notice that your feet and legs are tingling and then the tingling turns to numbness. there's a burst of adreneline. then you panic. why is this happening? you become more aware of your heartbeat and the speed and the feeling and the skipped or missed beats. the beating feels so hard and its like your heart is trying to escape from your chest. the trembling starts. your chest tightens and tightens. you cry. you get really warm. you feel like you're not getting enough oxygen so you place your hand in front of your nose to make sure you're actually breathing and you are, and you're confused. you try to breath deeper and harder and you end up starting to hyperventilate. then you worry. you cry more. you're not sure why you're worried but you are and you can't help it. sometimes you worry about dying. you start thinking about all of the things that you're afraid of, like death. your fears are sometimes irrational but they're fears all the same. you worry about life and things that stress you out. you worry about those irrational fears. it worsens. you work to calm your breathing and try to clear your mind. minutes and seconds pass — sometimes it's 5 minutes and sometimes it's 15. once you're able to get a grip, you're exhausted. you're hazy. you feel like you could sleep for a year.  normally afterwards i just end up sleeping. depending on the situation and my mood, i can sometimes be ok once i wake up but there have been times where i've felt a little off for a few days after. the difference between random attacks and triggered attacks are that the ones with triggers are usually easier to deal with. what i mean by that is i can usually figure out why i'm worried and therefore work to calm down faster. if i'm feeling unsafe in an area of a place i've never been or if the airplane i'm on is experiencing a lot of turbulence, the panic attack is easier to get a grip on. panic attacks with no real cause are tough because you're unsure of what set it off and then end up just worrying about everything.</th>\n",
